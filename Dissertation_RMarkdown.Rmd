# Chapter 1 - Introduction

## Higher Education and the Pursuit of Prestige

      Higher education is a complex system of individual institutions dealing with competing social, political, and economic pressures. Survival in this environment results from making difficult decisions amidst competing priorities. Even with the noblest of intentions, an abundance of information, and skillful leadership, what may appear to be a strategic decision in one moment can lead to unintended consequences in the future. Institutional decision-makers may fail to grasp the proper balance of trade-offs. Worse, the incentives within and outside the higher education system have led institutional leaders to prioritize the attainment of one commodity over all others - prestige (Bowen, 1980, Marginson, S., 2006, Melguizo, T. & Strober, M. H. 2007, & Torres-Olave, B., Brown, A. M., Carrera, L. F., & Ballinas, C., 2018). The pursuit of prestige is associated with its own set of drawbacks and unintended consequences. Time and again, when higher education institutions pursue prestige at all costs, students often must cope with the negative impacts (Chu, J., 2021, Kim, J., 2018, Kim, J., Kim, J., Jaquette, O., & Bastedo, M. N., 2014, & Morphew, C. C. & Baker, B. D., 2004).\
      Prestige as an institutional priority is seen across the higher education system today and is clearly evident in rankings systems such as the *U.S. News and World Report’s (USNWR)* annual college rankings. In their landmark book *In Pursuit of Prestige: Strategy and Competition in U.S. Higher Education*, Brewer, Gates, and Goodman (2001) identify selective admissions as a prominent market where institutions engage in a zero sum competition to gain prestige. Selective admissions is the strategy of maximizing the number of applications to the institution and minimizing the number of admitted students while simultaneously increasing the academic standards (high school GPA and standardized test scores) year-over-year (Brewer, Gates, & Goodman, 2001 & Karabel, J., 2005, Killgore, 2009). Many studies have demonstrated the relationship between increasing selectivity and its positive impact on institutional rankings (Bound, Hershbein, & Long, 2009, Griffith and Rask 2007, Lovett 2005, Volkwein and Sweitzer 2006). Meredith (2004), for example, studied institutions in the 1990s and found that more selective admissions rates improved rankings. As universities admit more students from the top quartile of their high school class, Schmidt (2008) finds that these institutions are more likely to increase their rankings. News stories about how administrative compensation and bonuses may be tied to rankings, such as Arizona State University president Michael Crow receiving a $60,000 performance bonus based on increasing the university’s *USNWR* ranking, demonstrate just how focused institutions are on prestige (Sneed 2008). Despite total U.S. college enrollment doubling over the past century, elite institutions have maintained the same enrollment in the face of increased demand that Blair and Smetters (2021) demonstrate can only be explained by the pursuit of prestige.\
      In addition to selective admissions, another avenue to increase an institution’s ranking and gain prestige is through demonstrably valuable faculty research. Faculty are socialized to this quickly from graduate school through the hiring process (Landrum & Clump, 2004). Universities primarily incentivize their faculty to conduct research, especially externally funded research, rather than interact with students (Fairweather, 2002). Melguizo and Strober (2007) found that faculty were not rewarded to spend time on their teaching in any type of university. Additionally, while frequent and positive interaction between students and faculty enhance students’ persistence and retention (Hernandez, 2000; Jackson et al., 2003), it is increasingly rare because faculty spend a majority of their time on research (Chang, 2005). Faculty recognize the pressure they face to produce research. As Serow (2000) argues, faculty may experience a conflict between reward and evaluation systems and their own values and efforts. The pressure to publish has only been intensified over time, as professors across higher education are asked to do more for the same salary and with the same incentives (Milem et al., 2000; Link et al., 2008). The pressures on faculty to produce research at the expense of student learning is a common, concerning, and predictable outcome when institutions prioritize accumulating prestige.\
      A third area where the pursuit of prestige precipitates negative consequences is the increasing rate and complexity of academic and corporate relationships. University-industry research relations (UIRRs) have been a part of higher education for a long time as noted by Slaughter and Rhoades (1996), who developed the concept of “academic capitalism” to focus attention on research universities as the center of a knowledge economy. They define academic capitalism as, "the pursuit of market and marketlike activities to generate external revenues" (Rhoades, Slaughter, & Slaughter, 2004, p. 11). In the context of corporate and institutional relationships, they remark, "the academic capitalism knowledge regime values knowledge privatizationa nd profit taking in which institutions, inventor faculty, and corporations have claims that come before those of the public" (Rhoades, Slaughter, & Slaughter, 2004, p. 29). The tension between the value of higher education institutions as a generator of economic development and its autonomy from corporate and industrial interests is a long-standing concern (Glenna et al., 2007a,b; Swedberg, 1998). An increasing emphasis on UIRRs has developed for a plethora of reasons. First, legal reforms, such as the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act and the 1986 Federal Technology Transfer Act, created a fertile environment for UIRRs (Busch, Lacy, Burkhardt, & Lacy, 1991). Second, industry is increasingly having a role in shaping educational mission statements as institutions develop a dependence on third-party revenues from industry (Clark 1998; Etzkowitz 2002). Third, the relationship bleeds over on both sides of the relationship. For industry, the leading technologies across sectors are primarily driven by commercializing technology from universities (Mowery et al., 2004). For universities, there is a spillover in both organizational structure (financial management, business process engineering) and practice (customer relations management, data mining) (Eaton et al., 2013). It is no coincidence that the increased revenue from industry relationships coincides with other focused revenue generating practices, such as diversifying the sources of students, opening international branch campuses, and/or licensing new educational initiatives (Knight & Morshidi, 2011; Wildaysky, 2010). Of course, accompanying any revenue gains for institutions is a sizeable boost in both the institutional relevance and reputation (prestige) that drives further economic opportunities (Kunhardt, 2004). Therefore, institutions gain both resources and prestige when they expand UIRRs, commodities highly sought after by administrative officials.\
      Pursuing prestige at all costs, whether by increasing selectivity, focusing faculty on their research, or developing UIRRs is not without consequence. Selective admissions leads to a homogenization of student enrollment, loss of institutional identity, intensification of work for faculty/staff, and an overall weak education for students (Toma, 2009). Professors experience heavy workloads between research expectations and course loads. This is why some faculty focus on making the preparations for teaching more efficient at the cost of student learning (Akerlind, 2005). Similarly, developing UIRRs can lead to problematic changes in institutional policies. Shane (2004) found institutions with the largest number of spin-off companies can be best predicted by the level of industry funding and the intellectual property policies of the institution. A strategy for overcoming the current decline in state support for higher education has been to structure research performed to be more cooped by U.S. firms (Buttel et al., 1984). For example, expanded patenting and licensing activities by universities since the 1980s reflects the seizing of economic opportunities and financial incentives at play in industrial and academic relationships (Mowery et al., 2004). Universities increasingly define themselves through their ability to monetize knowledge they develop and their contribution of developing human capital for economic developoment (Fallis, 2008 & Shapiro, 2003). As university and industry relationships develop, straying from the academic mission of the institution may be inevitable. This occurs because, "higher education as a whole believes in openness, transparency, and sharing - qualities that often conflict with the combative, winner-take-all corporate approaches" (Rooksby, 2016, p. 13). Prioritizing research over teaching, in an effort to continue generating revenue, pushes many public institutions away from the mission of educating students. In sum, institutions are setting priorities and making decisions to gain prestige in ways that often generate negative drawbacks to these same institutions. Selective admissions, focusing faculty on profitable research, and developing UIRRs are just a few of many examples. The prioritization of prestige and its accumulation at all costs puts higher education at risk.\
      Research on the pursuit of prestige reflects a deep well of academic literature that conceptualizes, explains, and predicts the organizational behavior of higher education institutions. Chief among the scholarship in this area is economist and former college president Howard Bowen and his “revenue theory of cost” or what has also been called Bowen’s Law. After a thorough empirical analysis of more than 50 years of data, Bowen theorized that the cost of higher education, “is determined by the amount of revenues currently available for education relative to enrollment… [and] by hard dollars of revenue and only indirectly and distantly by considerations of need, technology, efficiency, and market wages and prices” (Bowen, 1980, p. 19). This theory equates the expenditures of an institution being a direct result of the revenue the school can generate, not inherently tied to the specific cost of educating its students.\
      Though the cost of higher education being determined by how much revenue an institution can generate may initially seem unrelated to the pursuit of prestige, many of the five laws Bowen outlined explicitly connect the two. Bowen’s (1980) first law is that “the dominant goals of institutions are educational excellence, prestige, and influence” (p. 19). Bowen’s first law demonstrates with startling clarity how higher education has so easily discarded the ideals of intellectual and moral development of students through education. Bowen’s (1980) second law says, “in quest for excellence, prestige, and influence, there is virtually no limit to the amount of money an institution could spend for seemingly fruitful educational ends” (p. 19). With this law, Bowen is clearly identifying higher education as a market of competitors who compete over any metric that is perceived as excellence, prestige, or influence. In order to compete in the market, higher education institutions have no limit to the expenditures that they could make in the pursuit of those goals. These concepts, alongside the empirical work he provided in the seminal *The Costs of Higher Education*, showed that institutions prioritized the pursuit of prestige beyond the bounds of normalized budgeting into a framework that combined deficit spending, fundraising, and driving institutional efforts towards climbing the higher educational hierarchy. If prestige is the primary goal of the institution and as much money as can be generated can be spent on that pursuit, then it follows that any action in the pursuit of prestige can be justified, funded, and endowed in support of the institution.\
      Another conceptual framework to parse through the motivations and behaviors of higher education’s institutions is the idea of the striving university, developed by higher education scholar KerryAnn O’Meara. She presents the theory of the striving institution, which can be seen in many different shapes and forms. Striving, or “the pursuit of prestige within the academic hierarchy” (O’Meara, 2007, p. 123), is important to include in the theory underpinning this study because she notes, “campuses that engage in striving behavior are often making trade-offs without knowing what they are” (p. 122). Her framework addresses striving by its manifestations (both institutionally and behaviorally), origins, and consequences. She notes that striving is nothing but aspiring to climb any established ranking of higher education because of the assumptions that consumers have regarding prestige, whereby rankings equals quality. To identify a striving institution, O’Meara points to five broad areas: 1) student recruitment/admissions, 2) faculty recruitment, roles, and reward systems, 3) curriculum and programs, 4) external relations and shaping of institutional identity, and 5) resource allocation (p. 131). While institutions do not necessarily need to initiate changes in all five areas to be a striving institution, organizational changes in any of these areas can serve as indicators that an institution has become susceptible to the pressures of striving.\
      O’Meara recognizes six broad forces that push institutions to strive: 1) history, 2) economics, 3) ecology, 4) sociology, 5) politics, and 6) the nature of faculty careers. First, from a historical perspective, each institution has its own saga between its mission, position within the environment, competition, and myriad other factors that compel the institution to adopt striving behaviors. Second, regarding economic forces, in a time of dwindling state support for higher education, institutions are more susceptible to the economic forces of reaching enrollment targets and leveraging tuition discounting to achieve budgetary projections. Oftentimes these economic forces push institutions to enact activities that are striving in nature. Additionally, ecological and sociological forces are conceptually derived by institutions that operate within the same environment are inevitably going to become homogenized over time, sometimes naturally and sometimes through striving behavior that is meant to increase the likelihood of survival. Furthermore, that striving is a result of political forces is not surprising. The federal and state governments’ roles in higher education can create incentives for institutions to engage in striving. For example, legislators could earmark funds for a specific academic program, hoping to increase the local pool of qualified employees. In response, institutions become incentivized to reallocate resources to drive striving behavior within that program at the institution to acquire more prestige and increase the likelihood of acquiring these government subsidies and resources. Lastly, faculty salaries are increasingly tied to research productivity, a not so subtle influence over the striving behaviors of the academic leaders of the campus. These forces are as complex as the entire mechanism of higher education itself, functioning within the environment of higher education, at the institutional level, and at the individual level to enact striving behavior.

## Athletics and Prestige

     One area where the pursuit for prestige in higher education causes damage and leads to unintended consequences is in college athletics. It is not unexpected that the pursuit of prestige would cause harm in the college athletics space, as many academics have noted that college athletics is, “the oldest form of commercialization in American higher education” (Bok, 2003, p. 35). While higher education broadly has shifted over time towards increasing commercialization and the pursuit of new revenue resources (Kirp, 2003), the use of athletics by institutions within higher education to gain prestige is noteworthy. First, administrators may subscribe to the “front porch” theory, which holds that intercollegiate athletic departments provide visibility to the public for the institution and allows them to communicate with prospective students, parents, alumni, and the broader society (Shulman & Bowen, 2001). Athletics can be seen as the “window to the world” and is often the way that many if not most people know about an institution (Twitchell, 2004, p. 116). Trustees, college presidents, and other upper-level administrators often cite the “Flutie Factor,” referring to how Boston College defeated defending national champion University of Miami on the day after Thanksgiving in 1984 with a last second Hail Mary play from Doug Flutie. Boston College then experienced a 16% increase in applications the next year (Sperber, 1990). This phenomenon was recognized across higher education and fed into the perception that students equate athletic success to the academic and overall prestige of an institution.\
     The effect of athletic success on prestige is not simply anecdotal or just perception. Tucker (2005) found that a 10% increase in winning football games over a five-year period resulted in an average increase of 14 SAT points for an institution’s incoming class, while an appearance in the Associated Press top 20 football ranking or major bowl appearance resulted in an average gain of 12 SAT points. Financially, football wins lead to an increase in alumni donations (Rhoads & Gerking, 2000), as a single additional win can increase a football program’s revenue by 3% (Chung, 2017). Credit agency Moody believes, “a carefully managed, successful intercollegiate Division I athletics program can have a positive credit impact on a university” (Weaver, 2011, p. 18). Given the capacity to impact prestige, institutions within higher education have plenty of reasons to fund and support an athletics program that endeavors to ascend the college athletics hierarchy. The issue is what and where the consequences for the decision to pursue prestige in college athletics will be felt.\
     Often the ones who immediately feel the consequences of institutions pursuing prestige in athletics are the student athletes themselves. Highly commercialized entities typically seek to reduce labor’s share of wages. The annual NCAA convention in 1922 is an example of institutions recognizing how commercialization and prestige were the goals of college athletics, but they draped these purposes in self-righteous propaganda to appease public concerns. They described a student-athlete as, “one who engages in sport solely for the physical, mental, or social benefits he derives therefrom, and to whom the sport is nothing more than an avocation” (Sack, A. L. & Staurowsky, E. J., 1998, p. 34). Framing the labor a student-athlete provides as an avocation and not occupation was intentional. Offering student-athletes no financial compensation is the core of the amateur model the NCAA has employed since its founding in 1906. Walter Byers, the first executive director of the NCAA, admitted in his 1997 memoire that the term student-athlete was made up in response to a threat, “the dreaded notion that NCAA athletes could be identified as employees by state industrial commissions and the courts. We crafted the term student-athlete, and soon it was embedded in all NCAA rules and interpretations as a mandated substitute for such words as players and athletes" (p. 137). Student-athletes are governed by a sophisticated set of rules and regulations that explicitly prohibit them from receiving any form of compensation or benefits for their participation in collegiate athletics. Many economists have drawn attention to the NCAA’s behavior, exhibiting patterns of a traditional cartel to continue to not compensate student-athletes financially (Fizel & Bennett, 2000, Blair, R. D. & Wang, W., 2018).\
     A central source of prestige in college athletics is men’s football. College football has a complex configuration of various divisions, subdivisions, groups, and conferences. At the broadest level, NCAA schools are divided into three divisions: Division I, Division II, and Division III. Only Division I can be further subdivided organizationally beyond conferences. Specifically, Division I has two subdivisions: the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and the Football Championships Subdivision (FCS). These two subdivisions are of comparable size, with the FBS consisting of  130 schools and the FCS of 128 schools as of 2021.  With these structures in place, the disparity can be quickly seen. Institutions in the FBS, being at the very top in prestige and revenue, are permitted to award a maximum of 85 scholarships to football student-athletes. These are “headcount” scholarships, meaning each student-athlete that receives one of these scholarships counts towards the total and gets a full scholarship. In the FCS and non-Division I schools, institutions can award a maximum of 63 “equivelancy” scholarships. An “equivelancy” scholarship is a full-scholarship but can be divided up monetarily among several student-athletes as the football head coach chooses. Moving further down the college football hierarchy, Division II schools can offer a maximum of 36 equivelancy scholarships, while Division III schools do not offer any scholarships. Though the number of scholarships at the top of the football hierarchy has been lowered over time to theoretically increase parity across institutions, Sutter and Winkler (2003) show that these scholarship limits protect historical football institutions at the expense of weaker institutions. This occurs because top schools often have unregulated resources to attract walk-on players who can supplement the scholarship pool of student-athletes, is still too high to weaken strong program's consumption of top-tier recruits, and limits both weak and strong programs equally to impact the historical domination of top-tier programs. \
     Within the top of the hierarchy (FBS), there is further parsing of conferences between three groups:- the Power 5, the Group of 5, and the independent schools. The Power 5 group includes the conferences that operate at the highest level of prestige and revenue in college football. These five conferences include the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), Big Ten, Big Twelve, Pacific Twelve (Pac-12), and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Group of 5 includes Conference USA, the American Athletic, Mid-American, Mountain West, and Sun Belt Conferences. While the schools considered to be FBS independent have fluctuated, the University of Notre Dame, University of Massachusetts, and Brigham Young University are schools that were at one time during this study's sample period that were independent. Additionally, whereas the FCS season ends in a tournament for the NCAA Division I Football Championship, the FBS ends in both a large number of annual bowl games and a four-team playoff called the College Football Playoff (CFP).

     Scholarship types and numbers, as well as season end format, are not the only identifiers of increased disparity within college football. The higher up the hierarchy you look, from Division III up to Division I or from the FCS to the FBS, the more revenue is being generated. This revenue hierarchy is driven in part by entry into the CFP. Schools that are selected for the CFP receive a much larger portion of the $5 billion that ESPN paid for the first 12 years of broadcasting rights (Bachman, 2012). Broadcasters also disproportionately pay to carry the games for the Power 5 institutions. Lastly, the annual winners of each individual Power 5 conference receive an automatic bid into one of the New Years Six, the annual bowl games (Cotton, Orange, Rose, Fiesta, Sugar, Peach) that generate the most revenue.\
     Today, the highest level of college football requires institutions to invest millions of dollars in staffing, operations, facilities, and support for student athletes (Tsitsos, W. & Nixon, H., 2012). For their effort and money, the 130 institutions that make up the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I FBS generated over $6 billion in revenue in 2015 (College Athletics Financial Information Database, 2021). Making it to the highest echelons of college football does not provide just revenue but also exposure and prestige. Given the money earned by being at the top of the hierarchy, schools clearly are not just competing on the football field but are also working to move between divisions, subdivisions, groups, and conferences to climb their way towards higher earnings and prestige (Groza, 2010, Hoffer, 2015, & Maxcy, 2004).  \
      Eventually the disparity between the revenue and prestige generated by Division I college football and the lack of compensation for student-athletes generated an insurmountable political, legal, and scholarly challenge for the NCAA and its member institutions. The context for the NCAA capitulating to demands in 2014 is important. On March 17, 2014, the National Labor Relations Board supported the bid of the Northwestern University football team to unionize (Grasgreen, A. & Lederman, D., 2014). On June 9, 2014, the NCAA settled a lawsuit by awarding \$20 million to players who had appeared in college themed basketball and football video games (NCAA, 2014). Further legal issues continued on June 10, 2014, when the NCAA was sued as a cartel that limited the earnings of student-athletes. This case, *O’Bannon v NCAA*, focused on the amateurism model at the center of the NCAA, justifying the athletes' lack of compensation (Lederman, 2014). *O'Bannon* would eventually be decided against the NCAA on August 11, 2014, by which point many of the changes requested by the judge had already been implemented (New, 20141). Lastly, on July 30, 2014, the NCAA settled a lawsuit with former and current football players to establish a $70 million fund to diagnose, study, and provide guidelines concerning concussions (New, 2014b).\
      While these legal issues were compounding, public concerns about college costs and athletics spending were mounting. President Barack Obama, for example, claimed that he was frustrated with college athletics, saying, “I see coaches getting paid millions of dollars… NCAA making huge amounts of money, and then some kid gets a tattoo or gets a free use of a car and suddenly they’re banished. That’s not fair” (Stein, 2015). Across 28 states in 2014, the highest paid public employee was a college football coach (Sauter, M. B., Stebbins, S., Frohlich, T. C., & Comen, E., 2015). Even assistant football coaches earned notably high salaries, with 14 Division I assistant football coaches making over $1 million in 2014 (Dodd, 2016). The generation of massive revenues through television contracts and the high salaries of administrators/coaches within college football made it ethically complicated to defend against calls for some type of compensation for student-athletes.\
      Recognizing both the pressure to compensate student-athletes and the opportunity to gain competitive advantage over lower-resourced institutions, the schools of the Power Five conferences, along with independent FBS school the University of Notre Dame, threatened the NCAA that if they were not granted autonomy in certain areas, particularly financial aid for student athletes, the schools would leave and start their own organization (Adelson, A. 2014). Therefore, legislative autonomy was granted to the 65 institutions in the Power Five conferences on August 7, 2014 in a 16-2 vote (Weaver, A. 2015). Autonomy from the NCAA was granted to Power Five institutions in certain areas, including financial aid and student-athlete health. Financial aid consisted specifically of cost-of-attendance scholarships being permitted moving forward as well as prohibiting the removal of a student-athlete's scholarship because of athletic performance. Health related changes included a new rule prohibiting players from returning to play in the event of a head injury without the clearance of a medical professional and required concussion training for student-athletes and staff.\
      In addition to granting autonomy to the Power Five conferences, another part of the rule change specified that Group of Five, independent FBS institutions, and FCS institutions were allowed to adopt or reject any rule changes that the Power Five conferences make (Solomon, J. 2014). With this change, the institutions with the most prestige in the college football space now had additional self-governing powers. Furthermore, institutions with less prestigious football programs, specifically the Group of Five and the FCS institutions, were empowered to adopt any rule changes that the Power Five conferences had developed. Thus, in effect, any Division I program could embrace the practices established among the more autonomous and more prestigious Power Five conferences.\
      Granting autonomy to self-regulate allowed the elite institutions at the top of the college football hierarchy to quickly introduce landmark changes to college football. Chief among these changes was the establishment of cost-of-attendance (COA) stipends for student-athletes (Ellis, Z. 2014). The COA is a figure that must be calculated, by law, by the financial aid office of every institution within higher education that offers Title IV federal student aid. The COA must include the average amount of tuition, fees, room, and board, as well as a book and supplies allowance, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses for the period of the student’s enrollment based on broad student categories (such as in-state, on-campus, undergraduate, full-time student). A COA-stipend, or grant-in-aid as the NCAA also defines it, is, “financial aid that consists of tuition and fees, room and board, books and other expenses related to attendance at the institution up to the cost of attendance” (NCAA, 2022, p. 209). The Federal Student Aid Handbook, which details how financial aid administrators calculate and implement the COA, says, “students must be awarded on the basis of a COA comprised of allowable costs assessed all students carrying the same academic workload” (Federal Student Aid Handbook, 2021, pp. 3-36). Student-athletes, like their classmates, take on a full academic courseload during the academic year. Therefore, the COA that is calculated for traditional students at an institution are the same for them and the student-athletes on campus - there is no separate COA calculated just for student-athletes.\
      Items within the COA can be broken down into two categories: billed costs and out-of-pocket expenses. Billed costs include tuition, fees, room, and board (if the student lives on-campus). Traditionally, football scholarships covered these four billed costs, but football student-athletes were left to fend for themselves in the other associated out-of-pocket expenses of attending higher education, such as books, transportation, and supplies. To pay for out-of-pocket expenses, student-athletes often received other financial aid (federal, state, or private grants or loans) that can go above the amont of their scholarship, up to the amont of the institution’s COA. Thus, the COA functionally acts as a ceiling that all aid can not go beyond.\
     For students and families across higher education, the COA is a better representation of the real cost of college because it includes those additional out-of-pocket expenses. Additionally, students and families are often borrowing student loans up to the COA. This is why Monk (2014) found that a 10 percent increase in an institution’s COA results in a 2.3 percent increase in average student debt (p. 133). Cellini and Darolia (2017) also found that the COA is the primary driver of the differences in borrowing between students in for-profit institutions and those in other sectors. Students and families may seek to receive the maximum amount of loan funds that the student is eligible for (the COA), despite the fact that the COA is comprised of averages of several potential expenses that may vary drastically from one individual student to the next. Families and students may trust that the COA represents what the combined billed costs and out-of-pocket expenses will be. Students, however, are fundamentally borrowing not for what they need but by a number calculated on their behalf by financial aid administrators.\
     Federal rules and regulations for Title IV aid administration do not provide detailed instructions for calculating an institution’s COA. Clearly certain figures like tuition, fees, room, and board are publicly shared information and do not require any work on the financial aid administrator’s part. But how the figures for books, transportation, miscellaneous, and personal expenses are calculated is not self-evident. In fact, the federal student aid handbook for financial aid administrators admits, “there are a variety of methods to arrive at average costs for your students: periodic surveys of your student population, assessing local housing costs or other pertinent data, or other reasonable methods you may devise which generate accurate average costs for various student cohorts” (Federal Student Aid Handbook, 2019). Kelchen, Goldrick-Rab, and Hosch (2017) analyzed the ways institutions calculated the out-of-pocket living expenses for the COA and found significant disparities between institutions, even ones that were within the same geographic area. Specifically, they found that nearly half of all colleges provided living-cost allowances that differ by at least 20% above or below estimated actual costs of living. One thing financial aid administrators cannot do is calculate a special COA for athletes, as the NCAA manual states, “an institution must calculate the cost of attendance for student-athletes in accordance with the cost-of-attendance policies and procedures that are used for students in general” (NCAA, 2022, p 207).\
     Given the ambiguity that financial aid administrators have in calculating the COA, there is the capacity to increase the COA at an institution, which would provide larger COA-stipends for football student athletes. While a larger COA enables the institution to provide larger stipends to football student athletes, a larger COA also increases the average borrowing of the institution’s students (Cellini & Darolia, 2017 & Monk 2014). COA-stipends fundamentally serve as a recruitment tool. If a potential football student-athlete receives full-scholarship offers from two institutions and one has a larger COA-stipend than the other, then that larger stipend may be the deciding factor in which institution the recruit attends. Recruiting is not a trivial matter - studies have found that the quality of recruits directly leads to an increase in football program revenue. For example, Bergman and Logan (2020) examined player-specific ex ante recruit ratings, team performance, and football-specific revenue and profit to estimate player valuations, finding that a single five-star recruit increases revenue by up to \$650,000. with five-star recruits increasing revenue by \$650,000. Similarly, Brown (2011) examined the marginal revenue product of premium college football players (those eventually drafted into the National Football League) and found individual players are worth more than \$1 million to football programs. Football coaches have expressed concerns about institutions using COA stipends as a recruitment tool. Seven-time national champion and University of Alabama football head coach Nick Saban said, “now you leave it up to the institution, and I think some people have manipulated their [COA] numbers because they’ve significantly changed from last year to this year, and that’s not the spirit of the rule” (Casagrande, 2015). His SEC rival and University of Georgia football head coach Mark Richt said, “I think it’s not a good thing at all. I don’t think it’s right that anybody should have that type of advantage or disadvantage, quite frankly” (Tucker, 2015). Football coaches are not the only ones with mixed feelings on COA stipends – policy makers, advocacy groups, and administrators all have disparate expectations of how the COA stipend policy will play out (New, 2015). For example, one financial aid expert said, “if the overall aid a school’s offering went up the same as a cost-of-attendance increase, then colleges are involving their financial aid in a recruiting shenanigan… if the amount of grants and aid hasn’t gone up, then schools are putting more burden on nonathletes. Either way, you’ve got a basis for criticism” (New, 2015). This burden on nonathletes would manifest as Monk (2014) has suggested with increases in average student loan debt at these institutions.\
      The COA-stipend did create a disparity in recruitment. Bradubry and Pitts (2018) found that schools with higher COA attracted higher ranked recruits since the policy change. That COAs are developed in different ways across institutions and that football programs have a vested interest in increasing them in order to improve recruitment suggests that institutions that wish to improve the prestige derived from athletics would increase the COA.

# Problem Statement

     Several scholars have noted that colleges and universities have developed a narrow focus on accumulating prestige to the detriment of its other responsibilities (Brewer, Gates, & Goldman, 2002, Kuh & Pascarella, 2004, Meredith, 2004, & Pike, 2003). These efforts are perpetrated across various areas, including utilizing selective admissions, emphasizing faculty research, and developing relationships with private and corporate entities. The consequences for the institution and its students are abundant. These problems include decreased public access to the institution (Ehrenberg, Zhang, & Levin, 2006), lower diversity among the student body (Shaw & LeChasseur, 2005), lack of focus on quality teaching (Ehrenberg, 2003, Massy & Zemsky, 1994, & Milem, Berger, & Dey, 2000), and reduced student support services (Kuh & Pascarella, 2004 & Wawrzynski, 2004).  Given the complexity of the institutional structure, the diffuse processes of decision making, and the siloed nature of each unit, individual actors within the institution oftentimes make well-intentioned decisions without the foresight of downstream impacts. One area of the institution may move towards prestige, while a separate area is faced with the consequences.\
     A similar set of motivations, fragmented decision makers, and unintended consequences exist within the college athletics space. Football head coaches and athletics administrators are consumed with discovering and maximizing any edge they can get on the competition. They are incentivized to do so; a college’s athletics ranking correlates with increased revenue and prestige (Rhoads & Gerking, 2000, Tucker, 2005, & Weaver, 2011). When the NCAA’s COA-stipend policy changed in 2015, suddenly an obscure administrative procedure within the financial aid office became central to the competetiveness of an institution’s football team. As college athletics are perceived as one market where institutions compete for prestige, this competitive context seemingly pushed institutions to increase the COA to produce the most lucrative offers to potential football recruits. This practice, however, ignores the potential harm that increasing the COA can do to the non-athlete student body when it comes to student loan debt. The pursuit of prestige by the athletics department with COA-stipends may result in much larger COAs, which increases the total amount that any student can borrow, and which might in turn lead to higher amounts of student loan debt. Therefore, this study focuses on the problem of how the pursuit of prestige through athletics may generate negative consequences (higher college costs and loan debt) for students.

# Purpose

     Higher education institutions have demonstrated that they pursue prestige over all other competing interests (Bowen, 1980, & O'Meara, 2007). This prestige-minded focus has impacted many areas of the institution. In college athletics, schools have already shown how the pursuit of prestige has exploited student-athletes by not compensating them despite the billions of dollars in revenue their efforts produce (Bergman & Logan, 2020 & Brown, 2011). Beginning in 2015, with new autonomy to award COA stipends, institutions suddenly had a new tool to improve recruitment for football. Research indicates that improved performance in football recruitment would likely result in improved performance on the field, in turn increasing the athletic department’s revenues and the institution’s prestige. But in order to reap those benefits, the COA would have to be increased. The first purpose of this study is to determine the effect, if any, of providing COA stipends to football student athletes on the size of the institution’s COA. A second purpose of this study is to determine the effect, if any, of providing COA stipends to football student athletes on the average student loan debt at the institution.

# Research Question 1 

*Did FBS institutions award COA stipends and, if so, did they cause an increase to their institutional cost-of-attendance ?*\
      Institutions may decide to award COA stipends to gain a competitive edge over other Division I football programs. This competitive dynamic may also result in frequent increases in the institution’s COA in order to keep pace with other institutions. Unfortunately, the COA is not an inconsequential calculation. The COA is calculated by an institution’s financial aid office. Many institutions award merit scholarships or need-based grants up to the COA. Any institution that increases a COA to award large COA stipends to football student-athletes would have to possess the resources to also fund all those awards. Additionally, many students borrow loans up to the amount of their institution’s COA. This is why Cellini and Darolia (2017) found when studying public institution student loan borrowing that even after weighing against student’s own financial resources and controlling for observed factors, the COA drives student loan borrowing. Therefore, a fundamental tension exists between increasing the COA to attract football recruits while likely increasing the student loan debt of the general student body.\
      In a similar study, Jones (2021) studied institutions in the Power 5 conferences after the implementation of COA-stipends. He studied schools in the Power 5 conferences, using them as a treated group and using  Division II institutions as a control group. Utilizing difference-in-difference causal estimation, he found that after the COA policy change institutions did increase their COA larger then expected. But this study was limited to Power 5 schools. This dissertation study aims to examine the effects of COA stipends at all FBS schools, including Group of 5 and independent institutions.

# Research Question 2

*Did the use of cost-of-attendance stipends at FBS institutions cause an increase in average student loan debt at their institutions?*\
      The COA is a figure used by parents and students to determine both the overall cost of attending an institution as well as how much money to borrow in student loans. Building off research question 1, if the COA is manipulated for the purpose of a COA-stipend (i.e. as a tool to improve recruitment of football players), then parents and students will not know that the COA no longer estimates the cost of college. Instead, the COA has become a tool for student-athlete recruitment. This will mislead parent and students into borrowing additional funds to pay for anticipated expenses, based on the COA, that will not manifest. As a result, parent and student loan borrowing can be expected to increase.

# Significance

     When prestige is pursued and other concerns become secondary, some area of the institution will fall prey. This phenomenon is seen in the hypocrisy throughout the NCAA’s history of claiming that Division I athletics exists for students’ educational development rather than providing free labor to generate prestige. The exploitation is evident, for example, in the stories of Dexter Manley and Kevin Ross, two successful football players who were later shown to be functionally illiterate after their athletics careers yet according to academic transcripts were successful college students (Ferris, E., Finster, M., & McDonald, D., 2004, Sellers, R. M. 2000) or the 18 yearlong academic cheating scandal at the University of North Carolina (Lylall, S. 2014). In addition to academic scandals, other notable dustups by those within college athletics demonstrate the widespread financial greed and disregard for the values espoused by institutions. These include Penn State protecting child predator Jerry Sandusky, an assistant football coach (Sablich, J. Fessenden, F., & McLean, A. 2012), illegal money transfers and a murder investigation at Baylor (Wise, M. 2003), the controversial handling of sexual assault allegations against Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston (McIntire, M. & Bogdanich, W. 2014), University of Southern California running back Reggie Bush receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments (Bhagat, M. 2010), and several Ohio State players getting discounted tattoos in exchange for signing merchandise (ESPN 2010). Each of these scandals demonstrate higher education covering up their athletics departments to conceal what would ultimately be a damaging incident to the institution’s prestige.\
      One particular example of collateral damage when prestige in athletics is sought by institutions deserves special attention – that the exploitation of primarily African-American student-athletes is a racial justice issue. Black males are 2.8% of the student population at Division I football institutions but make up 57.1% of the student-athletes on those schools’ football teams (Harper, Williams, & Blackman, 2013). Given the aforementioned revenue these black student-athletes generate and the minimal compensation they receive, ensuring that the athletic scholarship is meaningfully consumed in the context of a well-resourced and developed educational experience would seemingly be paramount. Yet black student-athletes report feeling that their peers view them as intellectually incapable (Hawkins 2010) and are not afforded leadership opportunities (Singer 2005). This process can start at the very beginning of their socialization at the institution, which for black student-athletes often emphasizes athletic performance over academic achievement (Beamon, K. & Bell, P. A. 2019). Many of these black student-athletes feel that their academic opportunities are shortchanged due to an inability to choose their desired major (whose schedule must align with their athletic commitments), inappropriate counseling, and NCAA rules (Beamon, K. 2008). In a scathing story about the NCAA, Taylor Branch (2011) wrote in The Atlantic that unpaid student-athletes are an exploitation that if anyone examined would, “catch an unmistakable whiff of the plantation” (p. 5). That the treatment of student-athletes by the NCAA has been recognized as a racial justice issue by many left-wing activists has created a rare bipartisan coalition between progressives and right-wing, free market activists against the NCAA’s anticompetitive cartel. Yet these issues are all fundamentally downstream impacts of an institutional priority to garner prestige in every possible avenue, particularly (in this case) athletics.\

# Chapter 2 - Literature Review

To place this study in the proper context requires a review of prior scholarship that it looks to build on. That this study draws from research in several areas is no surprise given its examination of the motivations and costs of higher education, college athletic programs, and the student loan debt crisis. Each of these entails a breadth of scholarship that spans multiple academic disciplines - from higher education to economics. This literature review will aim to survey the key studies in each of these disciplines for each of these topics.

## Athletics background
      College athletics is a divisive topic and has been examined from many perspectives, particularly by economists. Miller (2003) gives a well-rounded overview of the pros/cons of athletics in higher education. He recognizes that athletics can contribute to the development of character in its student-athletes, noting the superior GPAs and graduation rates of Division III student-athletes. That is counter-balanced, however, by the poor academic performance of the players in the revenue generating sports (football and men's basketball). Reviewing the finances of college athletics, he also finds only 10-20 athletic programs consistently generate a profit. Every other athletics department in the country spend millions of dollars frivolously to chase the dream of entering that elite status. While schools make significant revenue from ticket sales and television contracts, they also spend on administrative salaries, travel, recruitment, facilities, and scholarships. He outlines several proposals on how to fix the situation, including giving athletes a special academic program to pursue, paying student athletes, or to spin-out college athletics into minor league affiliates of their professional counterparts. He recognizes how unlikely any of these proposals are, saying, "bottom line is that colleges do not exist to entertain the masses. Yet, college sports are such a large part of our culture that any effort to reform and especially to de-emphasize them will be met with great opposition" (Miller, 2003, p. 46). He concludes by hoping athletic departments can be held accountable to meeting some degree of academic legitimacy.\
      Many have looked at the NCAA as a cartel and the market dynamics that have permitted them to maintain control over the market of college athletics for decades. Sanderson and Siegfried (2015) detail the mechanics that underlie college athletics. Like Miller (2003), they note how few (roughly 20 of the 126 FBS institutions) actually generate an annual profit. Most institutions are heavily subsidized by a general transfer of funds (referred to as 'allocated revenue') from the broader institution to cover losses. This subsidy amounts to approximately 20% of athletic program budgets at FBS institutions (Sanderson & Siegfried, 2015, p. 120). At the highest level, college athletics finances are kept afloat by the demand for live sports broadcasting rights, high demand in ticket sales, institutional support, and a cartel arrangement that limits compensation for student-athletes. The authors outline how college athletics convinces university presidents and boards of trustees to continue funneling money to such an expensive endeavor. First, many are convinced college athletics can be the draw to attract resources from state legislators, where public attention may otherwise push against funding for higher education. Second, a common belief (though loosely supported by the empirical evidence) is college athletics drive private donations. Third, the "Flutie Effect" mentioned earlier by Sperber (1990) where athletic performance can drive increased and higher quality enrollment, though this idea has also been loosely validated by researchers. Fourth, college athletics has all the attributes of an arms race or prisoners' dilemma, where each member feels pressured to compete/acqueuisce for the latest and greatest to "keep up with the Joneses." Lastly, schools put themselves on competetive planes with rival institutions through college athletics which in turns puts them in competition in other areas (academics, research, enrollment), which often can lift schools up. While this all explains how college athletic finances operate and the motivations of administrators across higher education justify the endeavor, these researchers go further into the economic system at play.\
      The role of college athletics in furthering institutional pursuit of prestige illuminated by Sanderson and Siegfried (2015) is further clarified by Toma (2010). He explains how college athletics are a real life manifestation of institutional culture that can connect both internal and external agents with the broader institution. He says, "it is far more likely a university will achieve notice nationally for its football team than for any of its academic functions" (Toma, 2010, p. 53). Critically, he points out that athletics is not isolated in receiving disproportionate internal subsidies that are for questionable utility to the broader higher education mission. Increasing commericalism and professionalism across higher education manifests in several forms - restructuring faculty work, recruiting advanced students, emphasizing honors programs, launching popular undergraduate majors, and establishing premiere student recreational and social facilities are a few examples. Arms races are not the province solely of athletics. That many institutions at the bottom of the FBS hierarchy feel compelled to provide substantial subsidies to the athletics department is not surprising. These schools, "justify taking annual losses on intercollegiate athletics given the hope that they will someday be able to benefit from the advantages associated with athletics prominence" Toma, 2010, p. 63). In the context of higher education existing in a neo liberal space where competition for prestige is tantamount, it is unlikely schools will avoid investing in college athletics as it increasingly has become a marker for prominance and legitimacy.\
      In a free market, higher education institutions would compete in wages over highly productive student athletes, Sanderson and Siegfried (2015) argue. What makes colleges so interesting, they say, is how an outside entity (the NCAA) have been effective for so long keeping wages near zero. Not only are compensation machinations tightly regulated by the NCAA, but so are the student athletes' treatment. Thousands of pages across hundreds of compliance documents laboriously explicate an intricate system that outlines student athlete labor conditions and remuneration, all towards the greater exploitation of the worker. This carefully engineered monopsony is the key. Given the low-wages offered to students, a highly elastic supply of workers is further increased by the unspoken coordination of the professional leagues of these sports. Sanderson and Siegfried (2015) find that student athletes are ineligible for professional positions due to their age restricts the opportunities for student athletes and further solidifies college athletics strength over them. The pay ceiling on student athletes manifests in the investment in other non-labor production components - coach and administrative salaries, exorbitant facilities, training rooms, and other expenses. Given the marginal cost of increasing the workload on the production inputs, it is no surprise that the number of games in both revenue generating sports has increased over time. Sanderson and Siegfried say, "NCAA members are the epitome of heterogeneity... [yet] the NCAA has been remarkably adept at creating and marketing its brand, retaining loyalties, beating back challenges to its market power, and resisting incentives for individual teams to cheat on agreements" (2015, p. 128). The researchers end their study by opining that only government intervention and/or private lawsuits could ever create meaningful change to benefit the lives of student athletes.\
      One branch of research into college athletics is investigating many of the alleged benefits it claims, such as the "Flutie Effect" as mentioned by Miller (2003), Sanderson and Siegfried (2015), and Sperber (1990). Pope and Pope (2009) attempts to determine if success on the field/court improves institutional outcomes. The researchers' panel data set contains data on 330 NCAA Division I schools from 1983 to 2002 that participate in basketball or football. Using a fixed effects model, Pope uses log applications, log enrollments, and log real tuition of institutions as separate outcomes with year and institution controls that are also run separately for public and private institutions. One set of controls is for success, as measured by the annual Associated Press' college football poll while basketball success was measured with a dummy variable identifying the furthest round in which a team placed in the annual "March Madness" year end playoff tournament. Lead and up to three years worth of lags per sport are also included in the model, as well as four control dummies that represent differently controls for quality of school (log total cost, log average professor salary, log average real income of the state, and number of high school diplomas awarded in state). Institutional data came from the *Peterson's Guide to Four Year Colleges*, IPEDS, Bureau of Labor Statistics (linking local per capita income to individual institutions), and the College Board. Results indicate that just being one of the 64 teams in the annual NCAA basketball tournament increases applications by 1% in the following year, increasing as schools progress through the tournament, up to 7-8% for the tournament winner. Similarly, being ranked in the top 20 for football increases applications approximately 2.5% the following year up to 7-8% for the eventual champion. Interestingly, private schools receive two to four times as many additional applications than public schools on the metric of basketball performance. All sports success increase the incoming SAT scores received and also show higher gains for private over public schools ceteris paribus. These results were confirmed in simlarly constructed random effects models. The researchers conclude that schools utilize increases in applications and test scores to increase overall student quality and enrollment size.\
      Another branch of research into college athletics explores their operational practices. Huffman and Cooper (2012) research how institutions can target recruiting at students based on college choice theory. They utilized a modified version of the Student-Athlete College-Choice Profile (SACCP), which helps understand the college choice factors involved for student-athletes. The population of subjects were NCAA Division I FBS players at a southeastern university who were offered and signed a grant-in-aid agreement prior to attending the university. 73 of the 84 football student athletes responded to the survey. Interestingly, subjects were asked for their hometown zip code in order for the researchers to determine the median household income of the student athletes neighborhood rather than asking them directly what their household income is as this was seen as unreliable. The researchers also did not employ any statistical significance tests due to the small sample size, fear of Type I error, and similar methodology employed by other studies with the SACCP. Student athletes overwhelmingly reported "the opportunity to begin a good career other than playing professional football" as the reason for why they attended the institution. Additionally, seven of the ten most motivating reasons for where the student athlete enrolled were athletic, rather than academic related. They say, "it is vital for athletic administrators and coaches to have a structure in place to emphasize the academic balance that is necessitated amid the football culture in an institution of higher education" (Huffman and Cooper, 2012, p. 240). This research supports the notion that many student athletes in football are attracted to institutions for their ability to increase their likelihood of high performance and receiving professional opportunities. 

## Pay student-athletes

      At the center of the issue over whether student-athletes should receive compensation is the degree to which they are supposedly exploited. Gatmen (2011) details many of the central points in a compelling case for reform in the collegiate athletics space. He says, "economic exploitation of student-athletes drives the academic exploitation of student-athletes... academic exploitation occurs when colleges focus too heavily on athletics over academics, resulting in instances of academic underperformance" (p. 511). Importantly, the article begins the focus on the disproportionate exploitation of young black men, who make up the majority of the student-athletes in revenue producing Division I sports. That student-athletes generate so much revenue for degrees they likely will not earn or cannot take advantage of demonstrates how these athletes are exploited. Another issue is special admit status, where schools are permitted to allow special students (student-athletes, musicians, dancers, etc.) be allowed into the institution with sub-standard academic credentials. Notably, an overwhelming percentage of the entire student-athlete sub-population at many Division I institutions are admitted under this program. The article details several high-profile academic scandals (Florida State in 2007, North Carolina in 2010, etc.) and how they are symptomatic of the tension between highly competitive college athletics and the academic mission of the institutions. All of these issues result in a series of proposals to reform the NCAA: 1) outreach programs to minority communities about the requirements of being a student-athlete 2) developing external regulating bodies to enforce academic integrity 3) improving institutional members' academic services and 4) develop 'farm teams' to filter out ilprepared and apathetic athletes from the academic environment of the institution. \
      While the case for student-athlete compensation could be made based solely on their exploitation, Gurdus (2000) provides a legal argument for why colleges and student-athletes embody the employer/employee relationship. His argument is centered around worker compensation claims, a legal method for employees to extract financial resources from employers after work-place injuries occur. Reviewing the history of such claims in the college athletics context, he sees cases being decided in both directions. He says, "many of the decisions holding that student athletes are not employees languish from poor reasoning" (Gurdus, 2000, p 916). First, both State Compensation Insurance Fund v. Industrial Commission and Coleman v. Western Michigan University, cases decided against seeing student-athletes as employees, were argued with the framing that college athletics did not benefit the universities. This is clearly not the case now, when football and men's basketball are billion dollar industries. Rensing v. Indiana State University Board of Trustees, another case against student-athlete compensation, completely ignores that colleges award scholarships to student-athletes that are contingent upon their performance and participation. Through legal precedent, several tests exist to determine if someone can be considered an employee. One such test, the control test, has four main parts: 1) direct evidence of control; 2) payment; 3) equipment; and 4) ability to fire. Student-athletes' scheduled are highly regulated through a strict series of practices, workouts, seminars, media availability, and other requirements demonstrating the program's control over student-athletes. Scholarships that student-athletes receive constitute a form of payment for the services student-athletes offer. Uniforms, apparel, and facilities are provided to the student-athletes by the institution. Lastly, coaches have the power to remove student-athletes from their roster at-will. That student-athletes fulfill the four prongs of the control test mirrors equal legal treatment that student nurses, medical-interns, and teachers have received. \
      Other legal scholars have supported the claims made by Gurdus (2000). Haden (2001) begins by saying, "in the modem day intercollegiate athletic environment, it is more appropriate to view universities as businesses that have interests other than merely educating their students" (Haden, 2001, p. 676). He outlines four main arguments against the 'pay-for-play' movement which seeks to compensate student-athletes beyond their athletic scholarships. First, as detailed by both Haden and Gurdus (2000), courts have inconsistently defined and measured the definition of employee in the context of student-athletes and higher education institutions, specifically in workers compensation cases. Second, given that higher education is tax exempt, any payment to student-athletes would create a clear commerical entity within the higher education ecosystem that would put the entire industry under the microscope. The IRS could quickly move to interrogate increasingly larger pieces of the higher education industry for tax revenue beyond just college athletics. Third, Title IX requirements broadly require institutions to provide equal opportunity, support, and resources for both men and womens athletics. Alarmingly, "unless universities can provide a proportional number of stipends to male and female athletes, the dis- proportionate number of stipends provided to male student-athletes will expose a university to liability under Title IX" (Haden, 2001, p. 679). Last, if institutions attempt to pay flat stipend amounts to student athletes they are likely to come up against the Sherman Antitrust Act as college athletics is clear an inter-state commerce activity. Any attempted coordination to control wages of student-athletes is likely to be challenged in court. Haden concludes by outlining the 'laundry money' proposal made by Thomas Hurst and J. Grier Pressly III. This idea would be to give student-athletes a nominal amount, approximately \$30 or $50, as part of their scholarship. This would give student-athletes additional resources to compensate them while avoiding any anti-trust, Title IX, or employee designation related issues.\
      Agreeing to compensate student-athletes would only be one obstacle on the course to correcting their exploitation - the next challenge would be to determine how to compensate them fairly. Sobocinski (1996) provides the legal history of the NCAA and the student-athlete compensation reform movement. He walks through the issues at the heart of the student-athlete/college relationship. This included the "relaxed" admission standard for student-athletes, the unrealistic expectations student-athletes have of becoming professional athletes, and the cultural prominence of college athletics. Similar to Miller (2003), he recognizes the value of college athletics, saying, "the value of athletics should never be underestimated. A person can develop many useful skills while training as an athlete: discipline, sacrifice, cooperation, perseverance, as well as creativity and physical expression" (Sobocinski, 1996, p. 267). But he stresses that the overemphasis on athletics competition over the education of the complete individual has resulted in hyper competetive exploitation of student-athletes. Several reform efforts include the Carnegie Foundation Report in 1929 and the Knight Commission Report in 1991. Current and future reforms recommended by the article include the movement towards structuring the NCAA around college presidents and board of trustees, moving student-athletes to integrate more into the general student body, and re-emphasising the educational experience of student-athletes.\
      Grenardo (2017) extends the legal review from Sobocinski (1996), particularly in light of the O'Bannon v. NCAA 2015 case and proposes a new model for compensation. Given the compensation coaches and athletic administrative staff make, the increasing number of documented cases of Chronic traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) in football players, and the aforementioned academic misconduct cases, the O'Bannon decision aligned with public sentiment that student-athletes deserved some remuneration. In this case, the court agreed players could receive stipends up to the calculated cost of attendance at institutions. The NCAA continued to insist that the amateurism was central to their product as surveys they conducted indicated lower demand in light of their players being compensated. These arguments and surveys were discredited by the prosecution and ignored by the Courts, which agreed to permit COA stipends. Grenardo's proposed "Duke Model" includes three types of compensation for student-athletes: 1) base salary; 2) athletic bonuses; and 3) academic bonuses. He argues, "fairness and equity dictate that the laborers and direct providers of a product that generates billions of dolflars should be compensated properly" (Grenardo, p. 177). The model would be generated at the conference level, with each conference deciding the figures and types (base salary, athletic/academic bonuses) compensation that student-athletes receive. Each school would report data to the NCAA who would function as overseer of the program. 

## Don't pay student athletes
      Not all scholars have contributed to the academic literature to advance the pay-for-play position. Osborne (2014) points out that the same 20 institutions as Miller (2003) and Sanderson and Siegfried (2015) that are able to generate a profit is actually proof that college athletics is not commercialized because a profit-oriented enterprise could not sustain itself at the rate the NCAA has. She also notes that over 80% of the funds the NCAA receives is used towards mission-centered work and places that favorably in comparison to the American Red Cross, American Cancer Society, and other nonprofits. Her view is that the high salaries that top coaches receive is justified because they contribute to the individual student athletes, who seek out institutions with those coaches on the premise they will increase their human capital. The scholarships that players receive are also only part of the compensation they earn - access to coaching, facilities, equipment, travel experiences, strength and conditioning, sports nutrition/medicine, and personal advising all have value. She rebuts the legal arguments, outlined by Gurdus (2000) and Haden (2001), that student athletes are employees. From her perspective, student athletes must be students first, maintain academic eligibility, and make progress towards a degree to participate. Any student athlete aspiring to progress towards a professional career is still bounded like any other student looking to maximize the opportunity of college towards a career to meet the expectations of the institution. She does not see what student athletes do as work, as, "some sports attract more fans that are willing to watch their games, but spectators do not change the nature of what student-athletes do, nor does it turn those athletes into revenue generators" (Osborne, 2014, p. 148). While a stark contrast from other researchers, Osborne puts forward a strong interpretation of the academic ideals that college athletics was founded on and should be held to in the world of billion dollar college athletic programs. \
      Many of the scholarship for student athlete compensation have received direct responses in the academic literature. Take for example Mondello and Beckham (2002), who write in direct response of Haden (2001). First, the scholars point out that the workers' compensation court cases involving student athletes include a diverse range of legal opinions and decisions. This includes *University of Denver v. Nemeth*, which found the football player eligible for workers' compensation due to injuries sustained during a game. They point out, however, that the football player also had a part-time on-campus job. This position was contingent on the player's on-field performance and, according to the authors, muddies the rational that decided the case. In *State Compensation Insurance Fund v. Industrial Accident Commission*, a similar workers' compensation claim was denied for a scholarship athlete killed during a football game. Similar to the *Nemeth* case, the player had a part-time on-campus job, but in this case the employee's student athlete status had no relationship to his employment. Thus, the claim was denied. Additional cases, such as *Van Horn v. Industrial Accident Commission*, *Rensing v. Indiana State University Board of Trustees*, and *Coleman v. Western michigan University* all show various legal theories applied to the nature of the relationship between colleges and student athletes, leading to disperate results. Mondello and Beckham (2002) state, "While a contractual relationship does exist between the institution and the collegiate athlete, that contract may be more appropriately regarded as a contract to educate rather than a contract of employment" (p. 299). Stressing the academic mission of higher education, the researchers claim options already exist to meet student athletes' demands for compensation. Namley, student athletes may acquire part-time employment, receive Federal Pell Grants, apply for funds from the Division I Special Assistance Fund, or student loans. They also support the type of reforms that today manifest as the NIL legislative changes. In conclusion, the relationship between institution and student athlete is voluntary and explicitly academic focused. Any changes to that would be widespread and disasterous for both parties. \
      There are no greater detractors from the rhetoric of pay-for-play and providing compensation to student athletes than the administrators running the NCAA. That is, except, for Walter Byers, the first Executive Director of the NCAA from 1951-1988. "I was charged with the dual mission of keeping intercollegiate sports clean while generating millions of dollars each year as income for the colleges. These were compelling and competing tasks" he said in his 2005 memoir, *Unsportsmanlike Conduct* (Byers & Hammer, 2005, p. 5). He writes about the many times he was pulled before Congress to speak in support of the NCAA's ideals of amateurism and the orientation of athletics towards education, ostensibly to protect the organization's tax-exempt status. Like many scholars (Miller, 2003, Osborne, 2014, Sanderson and Siegfried, 2015), Byers is quick to point out that most Division I NCAA members run sports deficits that are made up by subsidies from state legislatures, booster donations, or student fees. But this is only one of many issues facing athletics. He told the Associated Press in 1984 that, "as many as 30 percent of major sports schools were cheating on the rules-IS percent simply to win, another 15 percent because they felt they must fight fire with fire" (Byers & Hammers, 2005, p. 11). Though Byers comes to regret his role in the increasingly exploitative nature of college athletics and student athletes, even here he does not support paying the students outright. Instread, he supports the NIL changes that would eventually come into fruition and permitting COA-stipends. In his words, he says, "full-need student-athletes should be given additional financial assistance over the permitted grant-in-aid" (Byers & Hammers, 2005, p. 13). This is reflective of the state of college athletics roughly in 2021, despite his memoir being published in 2005. Despite his decades of developing, marketing, and defending the amateurism idea, even his late life changes in beliefs does not allow him to support student athletes receiving full compensation for their labor.\

## Cost

      Whether or not performance in college football or basketball has a relationship with a school's tuition is the focus of Alexander and Kern (2009). They explain that college athletics is often used to raise the profile of an individual institution. This "advertising effect" in turn permits increased alumni donations, earmarks from state legislatures, and/or the ability to increase incoming student quality. Their hypothesis is that success within these athletic programs shifts the demand curve right, permitting increased tuition. They utilize a fixed effects econometric model with controls for state and institution across the time period of 1987 - 2007 with data from IPEDS, the College Football Data Warehouse, and Ken Massey's *Massey Ratings* to construct their dataset. Notable institutional controls include the Carnegie classification, football/basketball wins, whether the institution belongs to one of the Power 5 conferences, if the football team made a major bowl game, and if the basketball team made the Final Four. They run models for fixed-effects estimation with robust standard errors, fixed effects two-stage least squares estimation with robust standard, errors, and seemingly unrelated estimation for both in-state and out-of-state tuition and fees. Their results show a statistically significant increase in tuition and fees based on many of the expected explanatory variables. For example, each football win was associated with a $31 increase and membership in the Power 5 was significant in several models. Their results also show the impact is greater on out-of-state tuition rates, confirming that public schools are quicker to increase tuition on out-of-state students compared to their in-state classmates. They also recognize the impact of Power 5 conference membership, who disproportionately reap the benefits of wins and playoff appearances. In fact, they note, "perhaps this also helps to explain the considerable amount of conference realignment we have seen in collegiate sports in the past decade as schools have sought to join conferences that they perceive as being more prestigious" (p. 252). In summation, the researchers conclude that winning leads to increases in tuition, moreso for out-of-state tuition, and that the impact has higher concentration among the Power 5 conferences.  \
      The relationship between college athletics and costs of higher education have also been studied from other perspectives. Jones and Rudolph (2020) research the relationship between the 'allocated revenue' detailed by Sanderson and Siegfried (2015) and higher education costs. They note these intra institutional subsidies of college athletic programs have seen a median increase of 124% between 2004 and 2016 in Division I schools. The study uses Bowen's Revenue Theory of Cost as its conceptual framework, recognizing that institutions are willing to spend all their resources towards anything that can generate prestige, in this case college athletics. They draw data from the Knights Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics and IPEDS between the 2004-05 and 2016-17 academic year for 231 public NCAA Division I schools. Using a fixed effects regression model with institution and time fixed effects, the model has time varying controls for core revenue, university expenditures per full-time equivelant, and undergraduate enrollment. Three separate models were used with outcome variables of in-state/out-of-state tuition and net cost, which lagged these dependent variables by a year to allow the independent variables to influence cost decisions. Results from the fixed effects regression models indicate that expenditures per full-time equivelant was the only statistically significant covariate in all three models, though only at the 0.1 level. Covariates found to have the highest statistical signficance were school funds and revenue for out-of-state tuition and fees and undergraduate full-time enrollment for in-state tuition and fees. They conclude that the study, "suggests that yearly increases in university funds play at most only a marginal role in the growing problem of college costs" (Jones & Rudolph, 2020, p. 74). This dilutes the argument made by Alexander and Kern (2009) that college athletics plays a significant role in the increasing costs of college. \
      That college athletics may increase costs as evidenced by Jones and Rudolph (2020) and Alexander and Kern (2009) avoids the unobserved counterfactual of what costs would be without college athletics. As Toma (1999) points out, college athletics present an accessible, exciting identity to outside actors that allows them to connect to the collegiate ideal. He outlines how many institutions use home and away games to gather local alumni, state legislators, and other key donors in the biggest pitches of the year by administrators to draw additional resources for the institution. This is because, "the paramount goal for any university administration is to use the tools available to improve the perception of the institution" (Toma, 1999, p. 86). Athletics is a straightforward, far reaching, and universal tool to assemble a diverse audience into the institution and form positive relationships. It is not everything though, as, "athletics may get an institution in the door—like the door-to-door salesperson—but unless there is something else to sell, the university will go away a failure" (Toma, 1999, p. 88). Colleges cannot use athletics as the only way to legitimize themselves, but it is an important mechanism to promote those accomplishments in research, teaching, and student success that may otherwise fall on deaf ears.\

## 2015 Changes

      Calls for a COA-stipend happened well before the NCAA policy change in 2015. Davis and Malagrino (2012) argue for COA-stipends, particularly in light of the *White v. NCAA* 2008 case which saw student athletes sue for additional resources past the grant-in-aid that covered tuition, fees, room, and board expenses to go up to the COA. They attack the specific rule, NCAA Bylaw 15.1, as violating section 1 of the Sherman Act because, "the individual student-athlete scholarship limit is an arbitrary price cap and an unreasonable restraint of trade" (Davis & Malagrino, 2012, p. 605). Even the proposals after the settlement in *White*, where student athletes would receive a $2000 payment, was insufficient and inequitable. They point out that schools in the same conference or in the same state have a range of associated living expenses that can vary substantively. For example, they demonstrate that St. John's University and Syracuse University, two schools in the Big East located in the state of New York, have different costs. The City of Syracuse is 39% less expensive to live in compared to Queens where St. John's University is located. Additionally, the illusion of 'full-ride' scholarships for Division I student athletes misleads them. On average, these football players are paying \$2951 in school related expenses not covered by their grant-in-aid (p. 618). They argue that student athletes should be able to receive full COA scholarships to cover the total cost of education related expenses if they are truely not employees but students. Importantly, Davis and Malagrino (2012) do not believe in any likely foul play with COA stipends. They reject the idea that, "big money schools will manipulate their university-set cost of living estimates to values higher than reality for the purpose of being more competitive and enticing blue-chip recruits to sign with their schools because they can offer more money" (Davis & Malagrino, 2012, p. 641-642). They see allowing COA-stipends as a stop-gap against the movement towards full on compensation for student atheletes and fully inline with the amateur model the NCAA purports to embody.\
      The policy changes that lead to the COA-stipend were a result of the governance changes made at the August 2014 NCAA Division I Board of Directors meeting. The Power 5, or Autonomy Conferences (SEC, Big 10, Big 12, ACC, Pac 12) were given authority to make policy changes in the areas of health and wellness, meals and nutrition, certain aspects of financial aid, expenses/benefits for student athlete support, insurance and career transition, time demands, academic support, recruiting, and personnel. Shannon (2017) reviews the legal history and the consequences of these changes. The first act took place in January 2015, when the Autonomy Conferences voted 79-1 to permit COA-stipends. He notes, "it is likely that the cost of attendance measure would not have been adopted" had the previous, cross-Division I structure been in place (Shannon, 2017, p. 80). Also, it is clear that the NCAA v O'Bannon case was on the mind of voters. Shannon (2017) says, "the prospect of court-mandated cost of attendance scholarships for football and men's basketball was decidedly a possibility in January 2015 when the Autonomy 5 conferences held their first business session" (p. 84-85). Overall the bifurcated split between Division I institutions as initiated in formal legislation by the 2015 policy change has made a number of improvements in the lives of student athletes, COA-stipends chief among them.\
      Other researchers have looked at the impact of the COA stipend policy. Bradbury and Pitts (2018) look at the impact of the policy change on the recruiting for the 2015 football season. Their data on recruitment comes from Rivals.com, a high school scouting provider. They use prior year institutional recruiting scores as a control in their model to factor in prior year performance, a dummy for conference membership, and additional controls for winning percentage, number of conference championships, and number of top 25 finishes in the preceding 5 years. Additional controls for average football revenue, entering freshman SAT Math scores, and the years of experience of the head coach are also included. The dependent variable is represented in three different forms - from reports by *CBS Sports, USA Today,* and *The Chronicle of Higher Education*, who all compiled separate databases of schools new COAs. Given the different survey methods employed, there is no complete database of allowances for all Division I FBS institutions. They use OLS regression to estimate their models. Their results indicate that each US$1,000 in a school's COA allownace increases the recruiting ranking between 2.07 and 4.35 spots. Additionally, a one standard deviation difference in COA is associated with a three-spot difference in recruitment ranking. The authors warn, "that cost-of-attendance allowances are correlated with college choices for athletes indicates that the estimates are not solely based on costs of living and represent a likely avenue for manipulation" (Bradbury & Pitts, 2018, p. 986). They recognize that college athletics has every motivation under this new policy to want an increase in COA as it will improve recruitment performance. However, they also say, "a consequence of this manipulation is that higher allowances have the potential to raise the scholarship costs to nonathletes and permit students to take on more student loan debt" (Bradbury & Pitts, 2018, p. 987). The researchers understand the impact that the COA has on the broader student population and the conflict of interest between athletics which is incentivized to increase it and the student body which benefits (generally) from deflating it.\

## Student loans and financial aid

      The 2015 COA stipend policy change by the NCAA does not impact student athletes in isolation. Many of the issues student athletes face with affording college, living expenses, and planning for their future occur within the same context as their peers on campus. Specifically, the cost-of-attendance is a number calculated by the financial aid office at each Title IV aid awarding institution of higher education and must be calculated for every student. Kelchen, Goldrick-Rab, and Hosch (2017) examined the COA at all institutions, comparing them to neighboring schools and their own estimates of what the cost of living is at each institution. They note that the method for calculating the COA is not standardized and had previously never been empirically examined. There are several reasons for broad estimations for living expenses in similar areas. First, institutions rely on their financial aid office to estimate these figures, who may be overburdened and under resourced to properly calculate the cost of living for students. Second, schools may serve different types of students and have a mission that leads to different estimations of living expenses. Third, schools may be trying to game the system. Kelchen, Goldrick-Rab, and Hosch (2017) say, "because financial aid eligibility is usually capped by the COA, a lower living-cost allowance is a way to limit the size of loans that students can borrow and the amount of unmet financial need they appear to have" (p. 949). They note cases like for-profit schools which have admitted to increasing the COA to increase private loans, a tactic to satisfy a federal accreditation rule that requires 10% of an institution's total revenue come from nonfederal resources. Additionally, the authors also mention the COA stipend policy as another motivation for schools to increase the COA. Financial aid offices are at the center of these tensions, often finding themselves without the bandwidth to make a trustworthy estimate of living expenses.\
      To complete their study, Kelchen, Goldrick-Rab, and Hosch (2017) use an assortment of data and an interesting research design. They took the listed living-cost allowances for off-campus students living away from their family for the 2013-2014 academic year from IPEDS. As a comparison, they generated county level benchmarks for local living expenses from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Living Wage Calculator and from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Critically, they took three metrics for the 50th percentile rents from HUD: 1) student living alone in a zero-bedroom apartment, 2) student sharing a two-bedroom apartment with one roommate and evenly dividing costs, and 3) an "age-adjusted housing expense" that factors in students 25 years or older living in efficiency apartments or 24 years or younger living with roommates. Food expenses were taken from the U.S. Department of Agriculture  as well as the County Cost of Living Index from the Council for COmmunity and Economic Research. Transportation costs were taken from the 2012 Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey. Health care costs were taken on an average per-person measure based on data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. They used several regression models to compaore the reported and calculated COAs. For estimated expenses of students living alone, they found 34% of colleges allowances were at least 20% below their estimates while 12% provided allowances at least 20% above their estimates. Using figures based on students having roommates, they found 20% of colleges had COA estimates at least 20% below their estimates while 28% had living-cost allowances at least 20% above their estimates. Looking at the age-adjusted living expense figures, 25% had living expenses listed at least 20% below their estimates and 20% had living expenses 20% above their estimates. There was clearly a prevalence of variation from calculated estimates.\
      The examination of COAs by Kelchen, Goldrick-Rab, and Hosch (2017) also gives a peek into the factors across several models that contribute to the higher/lower amounts of COAs that schools calculate. Namely, schools with higher percentages of Asian, Black, and Hispanic students generally had lower reported living cost allowances than their estimates would have expected. Private nonprofit colleges had lower allowances than public colleges, while high percentages of Pell Grant recipients was associated with greater amounts of variation in living-cost allowances. These findings race alarming concerns. Given that the study shows higher income students, "are allowed to borrow more money to cover their personal lifestyle choices than similarly qualified low-income students because of the college they attend, it can affect the types of experiences that students can have while in college" (Kelchen, Goldrick-Rab, Hasch, 2017, p. 966). The COA is an often-overlooked yet highly impactful component of the college cost and affordability issue. \
      A school's cost-of-attendance, whether accurately calculated or an inadvertant misrepresentation, still matters to students. Goldrick-Rab (2017) builds on the study by Kelchen, Goldrick-Rab, and Hosch (2017) in her book *Paying the Price*. From the institutional perspective, "raising their cost-of-attendance sticker price may cause a reduction in applications and a slide in national or regional college rankings" (Goldrick-Rab, 2017, p. 43). Institutions have plenty of motivations to keep the COA low, though the NCAA COA-stipend policy represents a stark difference. Artificially low COAs hurt students as well because, "if the true price of attendance is higher than the stated cost of attendance, families must make up the difference" (Goldrick-Rab, 2017, p. 45). Lower COAs let federal/state governments and institutions themselves off the hook for funding the actual cost of attending college when the COA is under estimated. That gap between grant aid and actual unfunded costs are oftentimes made up by student loans. Goldrick-Rab (2017) reports, "more than one in four students who borrowed the maximum amount of federal loans in the 2007–8 academic year also took out a private loan or had a parent who took out a federal PLUS loan" (p. 94). Students are often borrowing as much as they are eligible for and that ceiling of eligibility is the COA. Thus a connection between the COA and student loan borrowing is made clear.\

# Chapter 3 - Methodology
## Conceptual Framework
     The theoretical framework being utilized in this study of the impact of the NCAA COA-stipend policy on the COA and average student loan debt of the institution is Howard Bowen's revenue theory of cost and KerryAnn O'Meara's striving institution. The revenue theory of costs posits that institutions operate by spending as much revenue as they can generate rather than any excess revenue serving as motivation to lower price, increase efficiencies, make capital investments, or save for future emergencies. O'Meara's striving institution framework helps explain institutional motivation and behavior as driven primarily by the pursuit of prestige. Together these two theories help explain how college athletics, as one of many levels of a higher education institution, is made to ruthlessly compete with other institutions within the athletics hierarchy without regard for both financial and human harm to the institution and its student-athletes.\
     Bowen's revenue theory of cost, or Bowen's Law, was presented in the 1980 book *The Cost of Higher Education*. He provided an in-depth analysis of the costs and revenue associated with institutions across higher education between 1929 and 1979. Said briefly, Bowen (1980) wrote, "costs of operating colleges or universities are set more largely by the amount of money institutions are able to raise... than by the inherent technical requirements of conducting their work" (p. 3). Other notable observations that he made include higher education's propensity to not explicitly target reducing costs (Bowen, 1980, p168) and that institutions raise money in order to spend all they raise (pg. 19). His theory suggests that institutions of higher education enact perpetually increasing spending practices in a never-ending pursuit of prestige, excellence, and influence. In sum, the cause of the increasing cost of higher education is the amount of revenue it generates. Part of this is due to keeping pace with competition, as institutions are benchmarked against similar peers whom they compete with over scarce resources. Another cause is the inherent ambiguity that students face in pursuing higher education - without a concrete, objective reference to determine the quality of the education they are investing in, prestige and reputation are the only indicators they have to base their decision on. Another cause is the inability of higher education firms to achieve productivity gains from what is fundamentally a labor intensive commodity - education. Ultimately, institutions will never turn down additional revenue nor concede what they have is sufficient for the task at hand - from their perspective, spending to increase their prestige in the academic hierarchy.\
     Many scholars have utilized Bowen's revenue theory of cost to explain higher education in a myriad of applications. For example, many complex economic and financial models have been used to verify the legitimacy of Bowen's theory. This includes cost models showing the stronger explanatory power of revenue theory of cost over Baumal's cost disease (Martin, R. E. & Hill, R. C., 2020, Kimball, B. A. & Luke, J. B., 2016), how tuition discounting can be used, within limits, to increase institutional revenue (Hillman, N. W., 2012), how the global recession of 2008 made institutions behave as predicted by Bowen (Gansemer-Topf, A.M, Downey, J., Thompson, K., & Genschel, U., 2018), and other models confirming the expansive spending of higher education institutions guided by Bowen's Law (Ehrenberg, R. G., Rizzo, M. J., & Jakubson, G. H., 2003, Leslie, L. L., Slaughter, S., Taylor, B. J., & Zhang, L., 2012, Altringer, L. & Summers, J., 2015). Kimball (2014) analyzed former Harvard University president Charles Eliot and his 'free money' approach to validate Bowen's revenue theory of cost as his tenure predated Bowen's analysis by nearly a century. He concluded, "Harvard became the wealthiest university in the nation precisely because Eliot began to institutionalize the revenue theory of cost in the 1870s, four decades before other universities started to pursue that strategy and a century before Bowen codified it" (pg. 906). There has also been applications of Bowen's revenue theory of cost to college athletics. Hirko, Suggs, and Orleans (2013) explored whether DI college football coaches' salaries exemplified that institutions would spend (to achieve prestige in the form of team performance) all the revenue they have (from athletic related revenue). They concluded, "tuition is up, faculty salaries are flat, and athletic salaries are rising" (pg. 22) indicating that additional athletic related revenues were driving coaching salaries up in confirmation of Bowen's Law. Hoffer, Humphreys, Lacombe, and Ruseki (2015) use Bowen's Law to help develop their statistical model examining NCAA DI college football program's pursuit of prestige through balancing revenue and costs, contrasting it with a model based on an arms race theory examining coaches' salaries, staff, facilities, and other amenities of institutions and their rivals. They conclude, "results are also consistent with the revenue theory of costs in that own revenue increases are strongly associated with increases in total expenditure and investment in coach salaries" (pg 593). Clearly, the framework provided by Bowen's revenue theory of cost has helped many scholars study various aspects of higher education and how it is financed.\
     The revenue theory of cost explains the motivation and financial operations of higher education. Bowen says the dominant goal of higher education is prestige and that no amount of money is too much to spend towards reaching that goal. The only constraint on expenditures are the revenue an institution can generate. As revenue grows, these expenditures can reach out into areas unrelated to the core function of educating students, all to keep pace with institutional peers. Ultimately this competitive behavior leads to waste, as institutions spend frivolously to gain advantages that are “moves in a zero sum game... such moves force competitors to make similar expenditures with the result that all the players are worse off while their relative positions remain about unchanged” (Bowen, 1980, p. 23). Bowen's empirical analysis reflected this, as he saw the institutions with the most revenue, "spend a smaller portion of their budget for instructional functions and more on nonacademic staff and purchases of goods and services from outside” (p. 150). Bowen shows that additional revenues do not lead to increased, direct expenditure on student learning. Rather, surplus revenue is allocated to tertiary higher education markets that can contribute to institutional prestige. Thus using the revenue theory of cost means identifying a prestige generator and understanding institutions will move to acquire and dominate it through expenditures capped only by institutional revenues.\
     With this understanding of Bowen's revenue theory of cost it becomes clearer how NCAA football programs' behavior implementing the COA-stipend policy could impact the COA and an institution's average student loan debt. Prestige seeking institutions establish athletic programs to acquire  prestige. As athletic departments are solely equipped to tap into the athletics marketplace for prestige at each institution, Bowen's Law shows, "observed increases in intercollegiate athletic expenditure occur across all big-time athletic departments because they set expenditure equal to revenue and have experienced large revenue increases."(Hoffer, A., Humphreys, B. R., & Lacombe, D. J., & Ruseki, J. E., 2015, p 577). Whether in ticket sales, merchandise, television contracts, or bowl/game winnings, football programs are able to generate a significant amount of revenue. That revenue is put right back into the athletics department to help the institution acquire additional prestige in the athletics space. Because there is no clear upper limit to prestige, athletics departments will always seek out new ways to acquire prestige constrained only by the department's revenue. Given the role that student-athletes play in prestige acquisition, acquiring the best student-athlete recruits is a logical frontier for athletic departments and institutions generally to move into. That COA-stipends do not cost institutions directly only enhances the pressure to offer the best COA-stipend as athletics departments seek to gain competitive advantages over their peers.\
     Whereas Bowen's revenue theory of cost articulates the financial model of how institutions acquire prestige, KerryAnn O'Meara's striving institution theory helps illuminate the specific behaviors that are manifestations of the pursuit of prestige, the forces driving the behavior, and the type of specific consequences that are wrought by these actions. It is important to note that striving is, "broadly defined here as the pursuit of prestige within the academic hierarchy" (O'Meara, 2007, p. 123). She also notes that striving behavior manifests differently across the myriad of institutional contexts and what may be striving at one institution may not be at another. The indicators of striving she identifies are (1) student recruitment and admissions, (2) faculty recruitment, roles, and reward systems, (3) curriculum and programs, (4) external relations and shaping of institutional identity, and (5) resource allocation. Student recruitment and admissions includes increasing selectivity in the student body, whether by admitting higher GPA/SAT scores or using early decision practices. Faculty related striving behavior includes increasing expectations of research, decreasing teaching loads, and notable increases in faculty receipts of grants, awards, and prestigious fellowships. Curricular changes that may exhibit institutions seeking prestige is increasing the volume of graduate programs, moving away from remedial/development instruction, and more career oriented curriculum. External relations and identify formation can be seen to be striving when language, speeches, and other public facing signals focus on institutional prestige or forward progression along the academic hierarchy. Lastly, increased spending on competitive amenities or administrative staff can signal an institution participating in striving. O'Meara says, "no one of these characteristics necessarily indicates a striving institutional environment... a researcher looking to identify an institution as striving might examine whether it has exhibited an overall picture (or significant number) of these characteristics over the previous five years" (pg. 130). O'Meara's striving institution framework goes deeper than Bowen's broader revenue theory of cost in detailing the behaviors of institutional aspiration for prestige.\
     Another feature of O'Meara's striving institution framework is providing more detail on the motivation, or forces, behind prestige seeking institutions. Importantly, the forces she identifies, "operate within the environment of higher education, at the institutional level, and at the individual level to compel institutional striving behavior" (O'Meara, 2007, pg. 132). The first force operating at multiple levels to enact striving behavior is historical, where, "higher education can be explained through an institutions’ organizational saga" (O'Meara, 2007, pg. 136), meaning the specific context, ups and downs, and mission of the striving unit. Another force motivating institutions to strive is economics, as higher education continues to face dwindling public support. Ecological and sociological forces push higher education to strive, "as institutions maximizing their chances for survival by acting in the ways that protect them from extinction" (pg. 139). This is reflected when peer effects seem to draw out striving behaviors in institutions. Next, politics is identified as a force that makes striving behavior occur as, "actors at federal, state, institutional, and even department levels jockey for prestige as a scarce resource" (O'Meara, 2007, p. 142). That individuals at any level can drive striving behaviors is a noteworthy recognition of O'Meara's theory. Lastly, she notes that the nature of faculty careers also can determine the existence of striving behavior. Taken together, the striving institution theory helps provide a deeper toolbox to help explain at both the larger and subunit level why striving occurs.\
     Lastly, O'Meara provides detailed accounts of consequences that come to bear when higher education participates in striving activities. For students, their learning, development, faculty contact, and the entire campus climate are at risk. Many of these manifest in the admissions and recruitment space, noting, "the amount of Pell grants increases as a school drops in the rankings—or decreased as rank improved" (O'Meara, 2007, 161). The striving institution theory also identifies faculty as experience the consequences of striving behavior, as they, "experience increased competition in their work-place, pressure to excel in multiple venues simultaneously, a more complex reward system, and a less humane environment for balance of work and family" (O'Meara, 2007, p. 162). Many faculty also feel disconcerted when the goals they operated under are at odds with new institution wide direction, a common occurrence when striving behavior is initiated. Striving institutions also impacts teaching and service missions. If institutions prioritize faculty research over service in tenure promotions then both service to the community decreases as does out-of-classroom interaction with students. These are many of the ways institutions drift from their mission and commitment to student learning. Lastly, both students and institutional distinctions and diversity are reduced as they become homogeneous as a consequence of striving. Taken together, striving behavior sees higher education institutions adapt ubiquitous practices that lead to uniformity. Unfortunately, that mimicry also sees students experience a lower quality education and faculty experience increased pressures.\
     The theory of a striving institution put forth by O'Meara has been used in multiple studies to help detail manifestations, motivations, and consequences of striving. McClure and Titus (2018) showed how movements up the Carnegie Classification, a pure exhibition of striving behavior, was associated with strong, positive increase in administrative costs. Gardner (2010) showed that doctoral student socialization suffered in a striving context, as students reported, "peers who had left due to some of the consequences of academic drift, namely high faculty turnover and a feeling of a lack of fit with the department’s priorities" (pg 742). Luca and Smith (2013) found that a 1 rank increase in the *USNWR* rankings leads to a 1% increase in the number of applicants to an institution. Scholars have been able to use the striving institution framework to explore higher education in a new way. Striving happens at all levels of an institution for a multitude of reasons and scholars have responded by applying O'Meara's theory to many of these manifestations.\
     O'Meara's striving institution framework provides many tools for researchers that can be used in a multitude of methodologies. First, it illuminates how any individual institution, sub-unit level, or actor can be associated with striving. That a desperate set of striving generators can be identified sets the striving framework apart from other prestige centered theories of higher education. This is because it allows researchers to see manifestations of striving at whatever unit of analysis is worth examining rather than being burdened with a more macro lens, stuck at broad levels of analysis. Second, it provides a deeper insight into the motivations, or forces, at play with striving behavior. While knowing that prestige is the endgoal is helpful, to understand the context of striving through the six different perspectives can uncover additional insights. Lastly, a detailed and, frankly, unsettling list of consequences of striving helps researchers either prognosticate the future from observing acts of striving or measure observed versus expected consequences post hoc. O'Meara summaries the broad utility of the striving institution framework by, "isolating striving behaviors and associating them with a set of consequences (whether positive, negative or neutral)" (O'Meara, 2007, pg. 123).\
     Many components of O'Meara's striving institution theory seem particularly relevant to this study. In particular, O'Meara's striving institution theory helps illuminate the characteristics of these striving athletic departments and the forces that could be at play. O'Meara (2007) notes that institutions seeking prestige, "make ongoing investments to seek and enhance prestige. Sometimes these investments are in athletics" (pg. 124). Certainly the characteristic she identifies of striving institutions of resource allocation seems key. Here she identifies, "increased spending on infrastructure and administrative support... investments made in competitive amenities" (O'Meara, 2007, pg 131) as characteristics of striving environments. Given that athletics is inherently a competitive environment that draws resources in both administration, physical infrastructure, and student-athlete focused amenities, a highly competitive athletics program seems a clear symbol of a striving institution. All of the forces O'Meara outlines could be attributed as motivating striving in regards to athletics depending on the individual institutional context. That, "institutions that exist in the same environment, responding to the same stimuli, are likely to become more homogeneous over time" (O'Meara, 2007, pg 139) could be directed at the arms race between athletics departments across higher education in facilities and student-athlete amenities. Additionally, politics could be a relevant force in college athletics as, "striving may result from policies within universities that incentivizes competition and activities that will result in prestige" (O'Meara, 2007, pg 142). Combined, O'Meara's striving institution theory demonstrates that athletics departments are emblematic of striving as a result of their administrative and infrastructure focused expenditure use and driven by a litany of forces, including ecological and political.\
     The following statement represents the underlying logic for designing and conducting this study. If institutions believe (a) the goal of higher education is to acquire prestige (Bowen, 1980 & O'Meara, 2007) (b) football performance contributes to institutional prestige, (c) better recruits lead to better football performance, (d) the higher the COA-stipend the better recruitment an institution can attract, then institutions will do everything within their power to increase the COA-stipend, regardless of whether it impacts the COA or average student loan debt at the institution.\
## Data
     A primary data source for this study is the Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data System (IPEDS), a database that collects annual surveys conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Any institution that has a Program Participation Agreement with the Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) and offers Title IV federal student aid is required by the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide annual data concerning such areas as enrollment, financial aid, faculty, staff, finances, and other institutional data. NCES also provides a free online tool for institutions, government agencies, and researchers to explore the entire database of survey responses for any institution as far back as 2002. A major benefit of IPEDS is through its required response and standardized approach to survey items, interested parties have an apples-to-apples comparison between institutions. For example, individual students often have a combination of enrollment patterns between day-time/night-time, in-person/online, and full-time/part-time statuses. Despite the infinite permutations and offerings of individual institutions, IPEDS forces a standard metric onto such questions as what the full-time equivalent (FTE) is at an institution, namely, "the number of FTE students is calculated based on the credit and/or clock hours reported by the institution on the IPEDS 12-month enrollment (E12) component and the institution's calendar system, as reported on the IC Header component (IPEDS, 2021). For many of the data needs of this study, IPEDS serves as the primary source of information.\
     Another source of data for this study is the College Scorecard. Announced in President Obama's 2013 State of the Union Address, the main goal of this federal database is to help parents and students determine, "where you can get the most bang for your educational buck" (White House, 2013) by comparing individual institutions of higher education. One of the key contributions of the scorecard, besides having data on the same set of institutions as the IPEDS, is it connects individual institutions with other government agency disaggregated student-level data. Notably, this means anyone can see the average earnings, student loan debt, loan repayment rates, and graduate rates of any institution awarding Title IV federal student aid. The Scorecard is not without its problems. Critically, student aggregate data is only reported for students who receive Title IV federal student aid. Although 46% of all undergraduates receive federal aid, it is highly and negatively correlated with average student test scores and income (Rothwell, 2015). This leads to an inherent bias to the data until the sample of students is expanded to include everyone. Another drawback is individual institution and program level data is excluded if they do not reach a varying threshold for privacy reasons. In general, the Scorecard can provide interesting benchmarks and unique data that cannot be found anywhere else.\
     To assist with modeling the COA, data was retrieved from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R). Since 1978, PD&R has provided data to policymakers, researchers, media, and the public. HUD and PD&R offer public datasets from present all the way back to 1983 for every part of the country. The chief datapoint from PD&R for this study is the fair market rent (FMR) of the cities and towns where institutions reside. Fair market rents, "represent the cost to rent a moderately-priced dwelling unit in the local housing market" (Office of Policy Development and Research, 2021). Many studies have been conducted across disciplines that utilizes FMRs as a proxy for housing expenses (Boeing, G., Wegmann, J., & Jiao, J., 2020, McMillen, D. & Singh, R., 2020, & Reina, V., Acolin, A., & Bostic, R. W., 2019). FMRs will assist in controlling with the actual cost of living at a given institution.\
## Variables
     The first outcome measure examined in this paper is the cost of attendance. In their paper on the COA-stipend, Bradbury and Pitt (2018) compare COA figures from separate databases provided by *USA Today*, *CBS Sports*, and *The Chronicle for Higher Education*. Each of these databases has incomplete data, both in responses from each FBS institution and in the methodology schools used to measure the COA. Data was also only available for 2015, the first year after the COA-stipend policy was made. They took the highest figure provided from each individual database and ran correlation analysis to demonstrate how similar each databases’ figures were. This approach would be inappropriate for this study, as a more longitudinal data set is necessary to see when certain institutions 'opted-in' to the treatment of awarding COA-stipends. In his paper on the COA-stipend, Willis (2020) uses the miscellaneous expenses data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). His reasoning was that miscellaneous expenses, “does not include room, board, tuition, or fees estimates of student costs. Estimated miscellaneous expenses are the amount universities in the treatment group for this study were able to provide student-athletes as a cost of attendance stipend” (Willis, 2020, pg 12). The use of IPEDS data for longitudinal analysis is the logical choice for this study, but which specific field to utilize is unclear.\
     Financial aid offices have to calculate two broad categories of expenses for students: room and board only for off-campus students and miscellaneous expenses for all students. Given that these calculations are the ones likely to be adjusted through the ambiguity of formal instruction on calculation methodology, this study needs to account for both. First, this study uses the other expenses data provided by IPEDS, which is defined as the, “amount of money (estimated by the financial aid office) needed by a student to cover expenses such as laundry, transportation, entertainment, and furnishings. (For the purpose of this survey room and board and tuition and fees are not included)” (IPEDS, 2021). IPEDS provide the other expenses separately based on the student's living situation - on campus, off campus living with family, or off campus living without family. Using correlation analysis, the Pearson calculation comes out higher than 0.5 for all groups, demonstrating that these three figures are related. In order to get at the COA that many first-year students who reside on-campus are given, the on-campus other expenses will be one outcome variable. Second, this study will use a combination of the off-campus (not with family) room and board and the off-campus (not with family) other expenses variables from IPEDS. Off-campus (not with family) room and board is defined as, "the charges for an academic year for rooming accommodations for a typical student sharing a room with one other student... [and] the charge for an academic year for meals, for a specified number of meals per week" (IPEDS, 2021). As this fits the definition of most upperclass student-athletes and  has two areas of possible manipulation (room/board and other expenses) this will serve as a separate outcome variable. \

     Other data points were used in the COA difference-in-difference model similar to Willis (2020). From IPEDS, data on each institution that would be used to calculate the COA were used. First, the percentage of age 25 or older students for each institution was taken because that helps identify how many students are considered independent for financial aid purposes. If a student is considered independent for financial aid, their COA is calculated to be higher than if they are a dependent student. Looking at the data, the over 25 years old variable is missing in 238, or 11% of units. Second, the percentage of first year Pell Grant recipients was also taken from IPEDS. Knowing how many Pell students are at each institution could account for how needy the student body at a given institution is. Kelchen (2017) found that institutions with needier student bodies had lower COAs. Third, a dummy variable for the type of institution was included from IPEDS that identifies the institution as either a public or private not-for-profit school. Fourth, from the HUD/PD&R the fair market rent was included in the dataset. The fair market rent is an important governmental data point, used to determine, "payment-standard amounts for the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program... initial renewal rents for some expiring project based Section 8 contracts and determine initial rents for housing assistance payment contracts in the Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy program" (U.S. Office of Housing and Urban Development Office of Policy Development & Research, 2020, p.17). Fair market rents for a one-bedroom apartment for the area closest to the zip code of the institution was used for analysis and modeling. Lastly, the log transformation of the number of full time equivalent undergraduates would help control for the size of the institution. These variables, taken together, will provide a model with the necessary data to understand any differences associated with the COA. \

     There are several indicators between the Scorecard and IPEDS which could be used to estimate the student loan debt at an institution. First, average amount of federal student loan debt accrued by undergraduate students is the outcome variable to examine the impact of the COA-stipend on student loan debt. This data comes from IPEDS and is described as, "any monies that must be repaid to the lending institution for which the student is the designated borrower. Includes all Title IV subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Does not include PLUS and other loans made directly to parents" (IPEDS, 2021). Second, the median debt, or "the median original amount of the loan principal upon entering repayment" (Scorecard, 2021) will also be used as an outcome variable. These two outcome variables show a correlation of 0.49, reflecting a collinearity of broadly measuring the same phenomenon.

corrplot(cor(FINAL_DATASET_LOAN_DEBT, use="complete.obs", method="pearson"), tl.col = "black", cl.length = 5, method="number", type="lower")
```
     Kelchen and Li (2017) studied which institutional factors were most associated with nonrepayment and cohort default rates. Among them, they found the percent filing as independents (vs. dependents), percent African American/black, percent Asian, percent first generation, state unemployment rate, state poverty rate, family income of independents/dependents, highest degree being a graduate degree, and whether it is a for profit institution were the characteristics with the highest statistical significance (p < 0.01) contributing to both nonrepayment and cohort default rate. Whether students default or fail to make a $1 payment towards their loan (ie nonrepayment) is not the same as whether an institution accumulates a significant average student loan debt, although heterogeneity between the two is likely. For example, while a state's poverty and unemployment rate reasonably explains a student's ability to procure employment and afford their student loans, it does not reflect why students at a given institution accumulate that debt. Student demographics seems a reasonable compromise - dependency, race, and first generation status will be included in the model. The family income metrics would lead directly to a student's need to take on loans in the first place, and will also be included in the model. Though likely correlated with first generation status, highest degree being a graduate degree is also being included. There are no for-profit institutions with a Division II or I football program, so that variable was also dropped.\
     Other variables for the average student loan debt model were drawn from Craig (2014). His study examined the factors that contributed to the average debt of graduating students as reported in the College Scorecard. He found that the amount of aid given to students based on quintile of family income, the total cost of attending an institution (billed cost minus aid), percent of students associated with living on campus/off campus/with family, the 75th percentile scholastic aptitude test (SAT or rescaled ACT), and the percent of students who dropped out in their first year as statistically significant (p < 0.01) contributors to the average student loan debt. Each of these variables will be included in the average student loan debt model as Craig (2014) shows they can account for student loan debt levels at an institution.

     A difficult data point to retrieve was determining if institutions’ athletic departments offered COA stipends and, if so, since when. While COA data is available for all institutions that offer Title IV federal financial aid, whether athletic departments offer the COA stipend is not reported on in any federal database. While all the Power 5 Conference teams of the FBS made it clear they were looking to offer COA stipends at the start of the 2015 season, the Group of 5, FBS-independent, and FCS schools were not required to award them. No single database exists that records which institutions actually offered the COA stipends or if they did, when they started. In order to gather this information, the researcher sent a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to each public institution. Schools were asked which items were covered by athletic scholarships (tuition, fees, room, board, books, transportation, etc.), if the school offered full scholarships up to the COA, and if so, when were these full COA scholarships offered. While some schools (University of Arkansas at Little Rock, Western Kentucky University, and others) would not respond to requests from non-residents, others outlined precisely what they offered student athletes. For schools that did not give a full accounting of their practices, the researcher emailed and called institutional staff in the Athletics Department, generally reaching out to those working in Athletics Compliance. Individual staff were sought to confirm the policy and history at each institution.\
## Sample 
     The focus of this study is to examine if the ability to offer COA-stipends lead to a statistically significant increase in the COA and/or the average student loan debt at the institution. All of the Power 5 conferences/institutions began offering the COA-stipend in 2015. The NCAA rule change was "permissive," meaning individual conferences/institutions outside of the Power 5 were allowed to opt-in to offering COA-stipends to their football student-athletes (Shannon, 2017; Solomon, 2015b). Nearly all Group of 5 conferences and FBS-independent schools began offering COA-stipends after the rule change. (Karels, 2018). Additionally, several of the FCS institutions also began offering cost of attendance stipends after 2015 (Kolpack, 2015; Lang, 2015; Tresolini, 2017). Which specific Group of 5 and FBS-independent institutions offered the COA-stipend and when they started offering them had not been determined up until this study.\
     Institutions that were members of the Group of 5 or FBS-independent schools were investigated to determine if and when they started to offer COA-stipends in order to determine if they could be included in the study's sample. A Freedom-of-Information-Act (FOIA) request was submitted to these *54 instituions*. The initial e-mail message can be seen in Appendix A. *40 institutions* responded, with *16* of them confirming that they did offer COA-stipends starting in various academic years. The remaining *48* institutions were contacted by phone to determine if and when they started to offer COA-stipends. Of the 64 Group of 5 institutions, only *2* institutions did not offer the COA-stipend at some point. *These two - Central Michigan University and Louisiana Tech University, were dropped from the sample.*\

     To find the sample of schools, the NCAA's website (https://www.ncaa.com/standings/football/fbs) and the official Division II football site (https://www.d2football.com/conferences/) were examined for the names of all the FBS and Division II conferences. The first set of data for the sample was drawn from IPEDS using the IPEDS data center tool. By using the Compare Institutions tool, schools were identified by the variable "NCAA/NAIA conference number football" for the eight academic years of the study (2012-2013 to 2019-2020). The initial list of conferences is in Appendix B. This resulted in  229 institutions. Given the discrepancy between this number and the total number of FBS schools, school existence in the sample set was scrutinized. \
1. Schools from the Big East that moved conferences when major reallignment happened in 2013 were excluded through this method but added back into the sample manually. The University of Cincinnati, Temple University, University of South Florida, University of Connecticut, University of Louisville, Syracuse University, University of Pittsburgh, Boston College, Virginia Tech, Rutgers University, and University of Miami were added manually, bringing the sample size up to 240. \
2. Three institutions from Conference USA were missing and manually added - Louisiana Tech University, Old Dominion University, and the University of Texas at San Antonio, bringing the total up to 243. \
3. Another three institutions, this time from the Mountain West Conference, were also missing. California State University at Fresno, San Jose State University, and Utah State were all added manually, bringing the total up to 246. \
4. The University of Arizona was also missing from the data set and added manually, bringing the total to 247 schools.\ 
5. Five universities from the Sun Belt Conference - Appalachian State University, Coastal Carolina University, Georgia Southern University, Georgia State University, and Texas State University, had to be added manually, bringing the total to 252. \
6. Oklahoma Baptist University was missing from the Great American Conference and was manually added, bringing the total to 253 schools. \
7. Two schools from the Great Midwest Athletic Conference, Hillsdale College and Kentucky Wesleyan College, were also missing and manually added to the sample, bringing the total to 255. \
8. Another two institutions were missing from their conference data set - the University of West Florida and Mississippi College were both manually added to the data set as members of the Gulf South Conference, bringing the total to 257. \
9.The University of Texas - Permian Basin also have a football team in the Division II Lone Star Conference and had to be manually added into the data set, bringing the total to 258 schools. \
10. Many schools were missing from Division II due to the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference closing down, with many members forming the Mountain East Conference. This includes Alderson Broaddus University, University of Charleston, Concord University, Fairmont State University, Glenville State College, West Liberty University, West Virginia State University, West Virginia Wesleyan College, and Wheeling University. Other schools leaving the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference include Seton Hill University and Shepherd University, all together bringing the sample up to 269 schools. \
11. South Dakota School of Mines and Technology were missing and added manually, bringing the total to 270. \
12. Four schools from the South Atlantic Conference - Limestone University, University of Virginia's College at Wise, Barton College, and Erskine College were also missing and added to the sample, increasing the size to 274. \
13. Three schools from the Southern Intercollegiate Athletics Conference - Central State University, Edward Waters University, and Savannah State University, were missing and added manually to the sample to bring the total to 277. \
14. Two institutions from the Great Northwest Athletic Conference, Central Washington University and Western Oregon University, were added manually to the sample to increase the sample to 279 institutions. \
15. Four FBS independent institutions, Brigham Young University, Liberty University, New Mexico State University, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst were also added manually, putting the sample at 283. \
16. Eight schools from the Atlantic Coast Conference also were missing and had to be added manually, including Wake Forest University, Clemson University, Florida State University, North Carolina State University, Duke University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Virginia, and Georgia Institute of Technology, increasing the sample to 291. \
17. Four other schools - Davenport University, Frostburg State University, Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania, University of North Alabama had to be added manually to bring the total to 295 schools. \
18. University of Alabama at Birmingham was also added as it is a member of Conference USA as of 2019, bringing the total to 296. \
19. The University of Idaho was added as they went from the Western Athletic Conference in 2012, to independent in 2013, to Sun Belt in 2014 and on to bring the total to 297. \
     A quantitative study of a group like the FBS institutions that awarded COA-stipends is best studied by conceptualizing them as receiving a treatment and identifying an appropriate control group to compare them to. While any FBS institution that did not offer COA-stipends may be suitable, it was quickly discovered that not many institutions opted not to offer COA-stipends. These institutions also would have felt increasing pressure to award them given that they were permitted to by the NCAA and that many of their peer institutions were doing so. Notably, Division II institutions were not authorized to award COA-stipends. This makes those schools the perfect counter-factual to the FBS institutions as they did not experience an exogenous shock of awarding COA-stipends and did not have peer institutions awarding COA-stipends at any time.\
     This study examines institutions between the 2012-2013 and 2019-2020 academic years. During that time, many institutions changed division, subdivision, group, and/or conference. Each type of movement between these categories impacts whether the individual institution can be included in the study sample. The fundamental consideration is whether the institution offered each student-athlete a full "headcount" football scholarship and whether they could have and eventually offered, at some point after the NCAA rule change, the COA-stipend throughout the period of the study. Given the taxonomy of NCAA football and this definition of the study sample, many different categories of institutions quickly call for attention. A detailed description and itemized list of individual institutions is included in Appendix C.\
     First, institutions that moved between individual Power 5/Group of 5 conferences would not be excluded because both had at least the option of offering the COA-stipend. For example, the University of Pittsburgh and Syracuse University changed conferences from the Big East to the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2013. As the Big East was a Power 5 conference at the time as is the ACC, they would be included in the sample. Similarly, inter-conference movements within the Group of 5 would be included in the sample, such as Western Kentucky University's change from the Sun Belt Conference to Conference USA in 2014 or Southern Methodist University's change from Conference USA to The American Conference in 2013.\
     Second, during the time period of the study, some institutions switched between Power 5 and Group of 5 conferences and/or as an FBS-independent institution, such as Rutgers University going from The American Conference to the Big Ten in 2014. Due to the fact the Power 5/Group of 5 conferences and FBS-independent institutions were all able to offer COA-stipends and they are counted as "headcount" scholarships, these moves are allowable. Rutgers, as a Power 5 school, did eventually offer COA-stipends, so they are included in the sample. 
     Third, institutions that moved between the FBS and FCS would be excluded in the sample because FCS schools could only offer equivelency scholarships while Group of 5 and FBS-independent institutions offered head count scholarships. For example, Georgia State University moved from the FCS' Colonial Athletic Association Conference to the FBS' and Group of 5's Sun Belt Conference in 2013 and would not be included in the sample. \
     Fourth, institutions that moved between divisions would be excluded from the sample because DIII, DII, and NAIA schools were never able to offer COA-stipends while FBS schools could. This would include the University of North Alabama, who switched from DII's Gulf South Conference to an independent FCS institution in 2018 as well as Savannah State University, which moved from the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conferenceto the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in 2019. \
     Fifth, institutions that came into existence or were inactive for an academic year during the period of the study cannot be involved. This is why the University of North Carolina at Charlotte was removed - their football program was started in 2013. Even forgetting they started in 2013, they started as an FCS school until moving to FBS and Conference USA in 2015. It should be noted that both St. Cloud State University and University of Minnesota Crookston were kept in the sample, even though the 2019 season was their last as the football programs were eliminated at the season's end. \
     The last group of institutions that require attention are the military academies. The players who join the United States Air Force, Military, or Naval Academy are commissioned for five years of active military service after graduating and must complete the same physical regimen as other cadets (ie basic training) during their academic career. Additionally,  cadets at these academies already receive free tuition, fees, room, board, and stipend for expenses regardless of any football related COA-stipend. Given the endogenous nature of military academies, these three institutions are being removed from the sample. 
     Some schools warranted special attention. The University of South Alabama is a special case because they were technically an FCS independent school during the 2012 season before transitioning to a Sun Belt member in 2013. Because the school was in the transition process for the 2012 season and played a schedule similar to what they would play during their first full season as an FBS school in 2013, they have been kept in the sample. Similarly, the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology was an NCAA Division II independent school in 2012 as it transitioned between a Division III team and a member of the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference, which it did in 2013. Therefore, it is being kept in the sample. The University of Virginia's College at Wise had dual membership in both the NAIA and the Division II's Great Midwest during the 2012-2013 season as it transitioned to Division II and is being kept in the sample. Merrimack College played in the DII Northeast-10 Conference for every year except the 2019 season, when it began a four year transition to the FCS' Northeast Conference. They are kept in the sample. Another strange example is Simon Fraser University - a public research university located in British Columbia, Canada. Despite the fact that it competed as a member in the Division II Great Northwest Athletic Conference during the entire period of the study, it is a Canadian institution. As it is not subject to the Title IV federal student aid policies, specifically concerning the COA, it was never added to the sample as they are not available in IPEDS. They are not part of the sample.\
## Difference-in-Difference Model
     The difference in difference (DiD) model is a quasi-experimental, causal inference method used by economists and other researchers looking to produce quantitative, empirical policy analysis. Researchers are generally interested when a policy is applied to a group (known as the treated group), that has some type of impact on an outcome of interest. This could be something like the impact of minimum wage on employment levels, abortion legalization on crime rates, unilateral divorce laws on female suicide rates, or the Affordable Care Act's Medicare expansion impact on mortality. In an ideal world, social policies could be applied in the same laboratory based, double blind, randomized control trial approach that is common in medical studies. Unfortunately, this is implausible in most contexts. The general idea of DiD is to compare the treated group to a similar group (known as the control group) who never receives the treatment at two points - before and after the treatment is applied. This "2x2 DiD" is the classical form where the control group represents the counterfactual of what may have happened to the treated group had treatment not occurred. Of course, longitudinal panel data is a requisite in using this method, but ultimately DiD is, "a version of fixed effects estimation using aggregate data" (Angrist, J. D. & Pischke, J., 2009, pg 228).\
     Both the treated and control groups have attributes that are both unique and constant to them - or fixed. These fixed effects can be held constant and controlled for in the DiD design. First, each group is compared to themselves pre/post treatment, removing the impact of the fixed effects. But this does not measure the impact of treatment - there is still selection bias as units are distributed between treatment and control. The differences found by comparing pre/post of treatment and control separately are then compared - the difference of the difference. These unbiased estimates are the actual impact of treatment. Put simply, Huntington-Klein (2021) describes DiD as believable when one cannot, "believe the untreated group would suddenly change around the time of treatment... treated group and untreated groups are generally similar in many ways... [and] the treated group and untreated groups had similar trajectories for the dependent variable before treatment" (18.1.4). A complex statistical methodology is constructed atop these fundamental presuppositions that ultimately assists researchers with isolating the causal impact of the treatment on the outcome of interest. \
     A DiD model was used most famously and likely first by John Snow in 1855. In this time period, it was not known how diseases spread. Snow believed that disease, specifically cholera, was being spread by dirty water. He had data from two periods - 1849 and 1854. During that time, many companies provided water to London from different points along the Thames River. Critically, who provided water to residents was random. This meant that neighbors often received water from two different companies. Notably, the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company and the Lambeth Company were providing water to Londoners that was sourced from downstream of the Thames, meaning Londoners were being fed everything that was dumped in the river back into their water. In between 1849 and 1854, however, the Lambeth Company was ordered by an act of Parliament to move their operations to provide London with water that was not downstream.\
     Snow's research design shows the hallmark of DiD models that are prevalent today and used in this study. He had two time periods - 1849 and 1854. He identified which houses received water from each of the two water companies, providing a treatment and control group. He calculated the average death rate in each time period and treatment/control group. There were clear distinctions shown between these groups - the death rate were similar for both companies in 1849 and for the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company in 1854. The Lambeth Company in 1854, now receiving water upstream of London, had a noticeably smaller death rate for its customers. In order to prove the robustness of his findings, Snow went to great lengths to show lack of heterogeneity in who received water from which company. Demonstrating that the control and treatment group met what now is understood to be the parallel treatments rule, he said, "each Company supplies both rich and poor, both large houses and small; there is no difference either in the condition or occupation of the persons receiving the water of the different Companies" (Snow, 1854, pg. 74). Given that the water provided to Londoners was randomly allocated and thus a change in one company's water was an exogenous shock to the system, a DiD model accurately calculated the impact of receiving downstream water had on contracting cholera. This famous study showed the power of the DiD model. \
     DiD does not function without a very strict assumption - parallel pre-trends. Cunningham (2021) describes the parallel trends assumption as, "a restatement of the strict exogeneity assumption... that we have found a control group who approximates the traveling path of the treatment group *and* that the treatment is not endogenous" (p. 422). While the method to measure the validity of the parallel pre-trends has fluctuated in recent years, there are many common components all researchers include. This includes pre-treatment analysis (often through visualization) of treatment's effect on useage and treatment's effect on the outcomes of interest. Generally, plotting the treatment and control is a valid start to beginning to confirm parallel pre-trends. Another common validation of parallel pretrends is a placebo test. A placebo test is done by subsetting the data to everything before the first treatment period and running the DiD test at random periods. Clearly, "nonzero DID effect at a period where there is no actual treatment tells us that the non-treatment changes in the treated group don’t exactly cancel out the non-treatment changes in the untreated group at the pretend-treatment time" (Huntington-Klein, 2021, 18.1.4). Researchers also look at group differences across a range of controls and time periods to confirm robustness. If parallel trends cannot be established, Rambachan and Roth (2021) provide a sophisticated set of statistical tools to provide for inference after imposing restrictions that can be verified through a series of sensitivity analysis. Lastly, the form of the outcome of interest has to be carefully considered. Whether control/treatment groups will change in absolute terms or as a percentage has to be decided upon and justified in order to keep the parallel trends assumption valid. \
     While the 2x2 DiD is a classical causal model commonly used in empirical research today, this study like many others will utilize a design with multiple treatment timings. When the COA-stipend became available to institutions, not every school began offering them for that first 2015 football season. Some schools waited a year or two to begin offering them to student-athletes. This staggered assignment of treatment across groups is also known as differential timing. Like traditional 2x2 DiD, studies looking to use the DiD framework with differential timing have multiple time periods with groups switching into the treated status (voluntarily or not) at different times. The regression model that studies like this use looks like this: \
     $y_{it}$ = $\alpha$	+ $\delta D_{it}$ + $X_{it}$ + $\alpha_{i}$ + $\alpha _{t}$ + $\varepsilon_{it}$\
Using panel data, the outcome for unit *i* at time *t* is equal to dummies for cross sectional units ($\alpha_{i}$), time periods ($\alpha _{t}$), and a treatment dummy ($\delta D_{it}$). This is often referred to as the two-way fixed effects (TWFE) model. Goodman-Bacon (2020) found that the TWFE model is a, "weighted average of all possible 2x2 DiD estimators that compare timing groups to each other (the DiD decomposition)... the weights on the 2x2 DiDs are proportional to timing group sizes *and* the variance of the treatment dummy in each pair" (p. 2). His decomposition approach helps researchers understand if their particular sample can overcome the bias of the TWFE model's weighting.\
     Determining whether the TWFE model suffers from bias requires a specialized diagnostic tests. Researchers must, "plot the constituent 2x2 DiD estimates by each constituent comparison’s implicit assigned weight (which is a function of treatment timing and group size) and constituent comparison’s type (e.g., earlier vs. later treated states or later vs. earlier treated states)" (Baker, A. C., Larcker, D. F., & Wang, C. Y., 2021, p. 17). Flipped signs in outcomes of estimators between earlier vs. later and later vs. earlier estimand effects is indiciative of treatment effect heterogeneity resulting in biased TWFE DiD estimates. This approach requires ignoring covariates despite further estimators often accommodating covariates.\
     The Goodman-Bacon decomposition is not the only applicable technique for determinging problematic aspects of TWFE such as bias.Baker, Larcker, and Wang (2021) provide tools for applied researchers to determine if staggered treatment designs are likely biased. Notably, they suggest, "our simulation analysis highlights the circumstances under which staggered DiD designs are most likely to be problematic: when staggered treatment is bundled with dynamic treatment effects [treatment effect varying over time]" (p. 4). They warn researchers to be cautious when interpreting treatment effects of staggered DiD designs, particularly when treatment effect heterogeneity is plausible. The primary method they suggest to researchers is event study DiD estimates, though carefully analysis with respect to confidence intervals and violations of the parallel trends assumption is crucial. 
     Given the popularity of the TWFE model and the revelation brought about by Goodman-Bacon and his DiD decomposition, additional scrutiny to these models has prompted an emerging literature on DiD methods. Many researchers have developed new estimation models to calculate treatment effects under different constraints on parallel trends, treatment timing, sample variance, and other considerations. The general methodology has been to utilize event study DiD designs that take on the general form of:\
     $$ y_{it} = \alpha_{i} + \lambda_{t} + \sum_{k}\delta_{k}II[t - E_{i} = k]+\epsilon_{it}$$ 
Which shows that the outcome ($y_{it}$) equals unit fixed effects ($\alpha_{i}$), time fixed effects ($\lambda_{t}$), the timing period when treatment begins for unit *i* ($E_{i}$), and *II[t - $E_{i}$ = k]* being an indicator for being *k* years from the start of treatment. One influential paper in this methodological space was produced by Brantly Callaway and Pedro Sant'Anna (2020). Their paper gave researchers the tools to identify, estimate, and infer the impact of treatment effects in the presence of multiple time periods, variation in treatment timing, and when the parallel trends assumption is met only through observable controls. The basis of their work is what they call the *group-time average treatment effect* ($ATT_{gt}$), or, "the average treatment effect for group *g* at time *t*, where a 'group' is defined by the time period when units are first treated" (p. 2). They provide multiple routes to calculate $ATT_{gt}$ and multiple other $ATT_{gt}$ based on the research question. For calculation of $ATT_{gt}$, either outcome regression (OR), inverse probability weighting (IPW), or doubly robust (DR) estimands can be used by researchers. Once an $ATT_{gt}$ is estimated, further calculations can help researchers develop an overall $ATT_{gt}$ for all groups across all times, based on specific groups, based on timing of exposure to treatment, or based on calendar time. The intuition of the $ATT_{gt}$ calculation is that by taking individual observations from both treatment and control groups based on differential timing and omitting other groups, then, "up-weight observations from the control group that have characteristics similar to those frequently found in group g and down-weight observations from the control group that are rarely in group g" (Baker, Larcker, and Wange, 2021, pg. 21). Given the flexibility in design and range of applications, Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020) conclude, "these differences suggest that using an approach that is robust to treatment effect heterogeneity and dynamics should be strongly considered by applied researchers" (p. 33). Other models by Sun and Abraham (2020) and Cenzig, Dube, Lindner, and Zipper (2019) also use similar (though minor differences) to estimate the true unbiased DiD estimator.  \

Later that year the O’Bannon decision was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in September of 2015 (O’Bannon v. NCAA, 2015) and was denied further hearings in May 2016 (Berkowitz, S. & Perez, A. 2016)

Benedict & Keteyian (2013) – compensating college student athletes is contentious with some thinking that paying them would reduce the likelihood of scandal and reputational damage while others believe it would lead to professionalization of what should be an amateur sport. 

Eckard (2011) – schools in automatic qualifier conferences act as a cartel as evidenced by their wins against  ‘outsiders’ but also demonstrated in their capture of BCS bowl appearances and revenue generation. 

Holmes (2011) - Current performance as well as comparison to recent historical performance (even above what could be considered ‘good’ performance can cause a coach to be fired. 

Dumond, J. M., Lynch, A. K., & Platania, J. (2008) – recruit decisions by the student athletes are governed by a handful of factors that include recent performance & being one of the 6 BCS conferences

Kelchen, R., Goldrick-Rab, S., Hosch, B. (2017) – FA calculated COAs differ 20% from estimated actual COA in both directions – lots of variation. 

Reynolds, C. L. (2013)– tuition/fees go down in election years for state houses. 

Goldrick-Rab, S. (2016); McKinney, L. & Roberts, T. (2012) – FA office too busy to do in depth COA calculations

Broton, K., Frank, T., & Goldrick-Rab, S. (2014); Goldrick-Rab, S. (2016) - Unanticipated financial challenges can derail a student’s career

Fording, R. C. Soss, J., & Schram, S. F. (2007) – letting FA develop COA can lead to inequities as seen by discretionary sanctioning by TANF administrators 

Tutka, P. M. & Williams, D. (2017) – COA scholarships could be considered taxabler income and could give advantage to schools in states without income taxes. 

Dynarski, S. & Scott-Clayton, J. (2013). Randomized trials may be the gold standard in research and policy evaluation, but education researchers have had to use ‘quasi-experimental’ where researchers identify a source of naturally occurring, idiosyncratic variation. If researchers can identify a group with access to a program and another that doesn’t for reasons that are either random or unrelated to expected outcomes between groups, then a comparison for these two groups can yield causal estimates of program effectiveness. 

Deming, D. & Dynarski, S. M. (2009), Seftor, N. & Turner, S. (2002), Kane, T. J. (2003), Kane, T. J. (2007), Abraham, K. & Clark, M. (2006) Many quasi experimental studies show that an additional $1000 of grant aid may increase college enrollment by 4 percentage points 

Avery, C. & Kane, T. J. () Calculating the net price of college for a given family requires understanding their finances as well as the rules of the Pell Grant, student loans, the tuition tax credits, state grant programs, and aid offered by individual colleges. Evidence suggests that students are quite poor at estimating net prices

Page, L. C. & Scott-Clayton, J.  (2016) – ‘However, it is difficult to infer causal effects based on non-experimental analyses of financial aid policy, because aid recipients are often systematically selected and/or self-selected based on characteristics (e.g., need, merit, motivation to enroll) that may have independent effects on outcomes of interest.’

Bailey & Dynarski (2011) – gaps in college attainment by family income have increased over time.

Kena, G., Musu-Gillette, L., Robinson, J., Wang, X., Rathbun, A., Zhang, J., ... & Velez, E. D (2015) – Gaps in college completion based on family income don’t go away even when controlling for academic background – students among top quartile on standardized tests, 41% from poorest families earn a bachelor’s degree vs. 74% for highest income families. 

Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, J. (2006) Dynarski, S., Scott-Clayton, J., & Wiederspan, M. (2013) – FAFSA is complicated and reduces access to financial aid specifically and college broadly

Grodsky & Jones (2007) Hoxby & Avery (2013) – misperceptions about the cost of college are widespread and common among students from the lowest income backgrounds, a likely factor in persisten gaps in postsecondary attainment 

College board (2012) – ran a program to clearly describe the net price of colleges to a control/treat group of families in low income area which increased treated groups understanding of cost. *But what would artificially increasing COA do to this effort? 

Hoxby & Turner (2013) – ran experiment where individual student information was given to treated group to help educate college net costs/application process.  Lead to increases in the rates with which students applied, accepted to, and attended high quality colleges

Riemer, B.A., Beal, B., & Schroeder, P. (2000). – student athletes experience social isolation on campus.

Anthony, A., Page, L. C., Seldin, A. (2015) – net tuition & fees can vary widely across students even among those w similar socioeconomic profiles. 

Hums, M. A. & MacLean, J. C. (2004) - In its most grassroots form, collegiate athletics started because of the growing popularity of student-organized athletic activities between students within the insular setting of individual campus environments (Hums & MacLean, 2004). Interest eventually developed to have organized competitions between different colleges and universities, and the first intercollegiate athletics competition was a studentorganized rowing competition between Yale and Harvard in 1852 

Duderstadt,J. J. (2009). - The NCAA also struck a deal with the newly formed ESPN to broadcast all men’s tournament games that were not televised by CBS (Duderstadt, 2009). Television companies sought out college broadcasting rights because production costs were inherently low. College basketball, along with college football, became both commercial and national products 

Clotfelter, C. T. 2011) - Whereas some universities are housed under the university umbrella, other athletic departments function separately from the university as an auxiliary entity Because of an athletic department’s inherent reliance on outside entities such as corporate sponsors, ticket sale revenues, and television broadcast payouts from its athletic conference, athletic departments function like a business more than almost any other university unit 

Giroux, H. A. (2007) – part of athletic’s major billionair funding sources are exclusive, million-dollar corporate sponsorships with apparel companies. 

Maisel, I. (2014) - ‘Autonomy will come with its own set of issues. Because the wealthiest schools are free to act upon their own interests, the rich will likely get richer. But it’s also a good bet that student-athletes will receive more benefits. That, at the end of the day, is the point.’ (paragraph 16)

Lawrence, P. R. (1987) – A cartel seeks to maximize the price of its product by limiting the product’s availability to the consumers, which is achieved by the producers’ agreement to restrict competition (p. 78)

Sanderson, A. R., Siegfried, J. J. (2018) – NCAA works as a cartel. Cartels must 1) reach agreement 2) control non-price competition 3) prevent cheating 4) deter new entry 5)distribute the spoils fairly

Eitle and Eitle (2002) found African-American males were 2.54 times more likely than whites to participate in high school football. 

(Messner, 2007). Sociologists have suggested that this prominence of African-American males in college football (and basketball) may be attributable to perceptions held by African Americans—and reinforced by the media, educational system, and labor market—that sport success creates race-neutral socioeconomic opportunities, including the chance to earn a college education and pursue a rewarding professional career

Due to isomorphic influences, new institutional theory suggests that organizations adapt to socially constructed values of their environment and have a tendency to behave similarly (DiMaggio and Powell 1983; Scott and Davis 2008

For example, Meyers(2006) finds that academic researchers who patent their findings (inventor–authors) generally publish at above average rates, but are not the most published university scientists. And Breschi et al. (2005) find that patenting has a more durable and beneficial impact on publication rates for scientists with more than one patent. While, Hicks and Hamilton (1999) have discovered that university–industryco-authored papers are cited more frequently than singleuniversity papers, indicating that university researchersmay enhance their scientific impact by collaborating withindustry partners. Franzoni (2006) argues that scientists boost their productivity by working on industrial technologies related to research applications.

We develop and empirically test a model of intercollegiate athletic departmentexpenditure decisions. The model extends general dynamic models of nonprice  competition and includes the idea that nonprofit athletic departments may simply set expenditure equal to revenues. Own and rival prestige are included in the athletic departments’ utility functions, generating rivalrous interaction. The model predicts that current own and rival investment has multi-period effects on prestige since investment is durable. We test the model using data from National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I athletic programs from 2006-2011, and the models incorporate spatial autocorrelation that captures dynamic rivalrous interaction. Results support the predictions of both models—NCAA Division I athletic programs appear to engage in dynamic nonprice competition in terms of expenditure and spend all revenues generated.

US District Judge Claudia Wilken wrote in her decision that the NCAA, "unreasonably restrain trade in the market for certain educational and athletic opportunities offered by NCAA Division I schools." (O'Bannon, 2014, p. 3).


     These COA stipends would be mentioned later that year in the aforementioned O'Bannon v. NCAA decision (2014). In her ruling, District Court Judge Claudia Wilken ordered athletic departments offer full COA stipends. The COA stipends were officially permitted at the next annual NCAA conference in January of 2015, passing by a vote of 79-1 (Sherman 2015).  \

"and if colleges are artificially inflating cost of attendance figures to make those stipends larger, then nonathletes could shoulder the extra costs."


Loan issue
Linsenmeier, Rosen, and Rose (2006) found in their study of several institutions that implemented a no loan policy, a 3% increase in matriculation by low-income students and a 10% increase in matriculation by low-income minority students. This suggests low-income and low-income minority students may be sensitive to the presence of student loans.

some claim there is no association between the proportions of loans to enrollment persistence (Bresciani & Carson, 2002; Braunstein, McGrath, & Pescatrice, 2001

others have found an inverse relationship between the volume of student loans and graduation rates (Jones-White, Radcliffe, Lorenz, & Soria, 2014).

Student loan debt has negatively impacted an undergraduate’s likelihood to go on to graduate school (Millett, 2003), reduced their employment opportunities (Minicozzi, 2005), and may also lead to poor mental and physical health, increased levels of stress, and social exclusion (Brown, Taylor, & Price, 2005; Drentea & Lavrakas, 2000

Specific attributes of students that have been identified as leading to high loan debt include being from a low-income family (Price, 2004), lower college GPAs (Thomas, 2000), and majoring in the humanities (Chen & Wiederspan, 2014).

Craig and Raisanen (2014) found schools in urban areas, where students on average take more than four years to graduate, or those with better students will borrow more
Craig, J. D. & Raisanen, S. R. (2014). Institutional determinents of American undergraduate student debt. Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management, 36(6), 661-673. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1360080X.2014.957892 

Baum and O’Malley (2003) found that students from upper‐income families receive support repaying their debts, which reduces defaults among wealthier students
Baum, S., & O'Malley, M. (2003). College on credit: How borrowers perceive their education debt. Journal of Student Financial Aid, 33(3), 1.


Student attributes that have been discovered to lead to default include having children or other dependents (Dynarski, 1994),), and not graduating (Podgurskey, Ehlert, Monroe, Watson, & Wittstruck, 2002). 
Dynarski, M. (1994). Who defaults on student loans? Findings from the national postsecondary student aid study. Economics of Education Review, 13(1), 55–68.

Although each of these measures gives us some information regarding a university's quality and mis- sion, we feel that a university's Carnegie Classification provides an appropriate means of measuring institutional diversity and quality. As noted by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, "[i]t has been widely used in the study of higher edu- cation, both as a way to represent and control for institutional differences, and also in the design of research studies to ensure adequate representation of sampled institu- tions, students, and faculty" (http://www.carnegie foundation.org/classification/). The
virtue of the Carnegie Classification scheme is that it takes many of the relevant meas- ures of institutional diversity into account, including those mentioned above. Thus, the Carnegie Classification "enables researchers to identify groups of roughly comparable institutions" iibid). The Carnegie Classification system is based on consideration of a variety of criteria, including the breadth of undergraduate and graduate programs, the institutions enrollment profile, and the size and setting of the institution. 


Write something like this:"Second, the tuition and fees data are reported on an academic year basis that spans part of two calendar years. So, for example. If the academic year is 1989-1990, we designated this data as 1989 and simi- larly for all other academic-year data. Third, we matched the data for f ß Wins and BB Wins to the tuition and fees data in the following manner: for example, if the tuition and fees data is for academic year 1989-1990 (or what we designated as 1989 data), wo matched these data with the 1988 football season data and the 1988-89 basketball sea- son data. In essence, we use the datafi-omthe previous football and basketball seasons and matched it with the tuition and fees data in the current academic year. We matched any of the remaining data to the tuition and fees data in a similar manner."

Something to do with inflation:"We have converted In-State Tuition & Fees per Student, Out-of-State Tuition & Fees per Student, and Per Gapita Income to constant 2007 dollars using the Higher Education Price Index published by the Commonfund Institute."

Look at Jones' 2020 paper on athletic/institutional costs where he uses IS & OS tuition+fees figures and net student costs (avg net price for full time, first time UGRDS) as outcomes for 3 different FE models. also may want to think about lagging costs "This lag strategy is common among researchers looking to model student college costs (Alexander & Kern, 2010; Pope & Pope, 2009; Smith, 2012)."

# Appendix A - FOIA Request\
To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Greg Chick and I'm a PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Boston. I am researching NCAA Division I college football programs and their response to the 2015 change in policy regarding cost-of-attendance (COA) stipends for my dissertation. I am writing to you under the Freedom of Information Act to get official confirmation of [INSERT INSTITUTION NAME]'s athletic department policy in response to this change. Please provide an answer to the following questions:

1. Does your institution provide athletic scholarships for football student-athletes that cover:

   a) Tuition
   b) Mandatory Fees
   c) Optional Fees
   d) Books
   e) Housing (either directly charged to student or based on an estimate)
   f) Board (either directly charged to student or based on an estimate)
   g) Personal Expenses
   h) Transportation
   i) Miscellaneous

2. Does your institution provide athletic scholarships for football student-athletes that covers the full COA as determined by the institutional financial aid office for each individual student?

3) If the answer to the prior question is yes, what years between 2015 - 2021 was this the case?

Thank you for your time in helping me with my research.

Regards,

Greg Chick \
Doctoral Student \

Category 2 - Inter-Group moves: institutions that moved between individual Power 5/Group of 5 conferences, and/or FBS-independent. Kept in sample.\
```{r, Category_2, echo=FALSE}
